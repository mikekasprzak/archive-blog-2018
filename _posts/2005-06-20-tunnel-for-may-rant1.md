GameTunnel&#8217;s [Monthly Roundup for May](http://www.gametunnel.com/html/section-viewarticle-115.html) is up. This was apparently a tough month to find enough games. Alas, we eventually made our quota of 14. Also, this is the 12th roundup, so guess what? The roundup&#8217;s are now a year old. Spiffy. I&#8217;ve only been involved for the past 8 months, but crazy &#8216;ol Mike Homel&#8217;s been going strong since the beginning. Congratz.

Too Normal has been quiet this past month, but hey, I haven&#8217;t announced this site just yet. There&#8217;s been an extremely vague teaser in my signature on IndieGamer for some time now, but I don&#8217;t yet have any stalkers there yet&#8230; or so I think.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

I&#8217;ve started fiddling with a new music tracker, Renoise. I havn&#8217;t really talked about audio at all here yet, but it&#8217;s something I plan to spend more time on. In my \*cough\* youth, I was a big fan of Scream Tracker and Impulse Tracker. A friend Mike and I used to do a lot of tracking with these, trading songs, screwing up each others songs, etc. I eventually moved on to Buzz Tracker, which I really like, short of all the crashing. Recently, I&#8217;ve been searching for a new tracker to compliment the budget recording studio I&#8217;ve built. I almost went with Psycle, but it can&#8217;t save VST settings!?! As for Renoise, I&#8217;m very impressed with the interface, and the price is quite reasonable. Tracker like, but evolved. The effects chaining is simple, but nice. I still need to see how it deals with VST instruments, but I think we have a winner.

Gold date for the project I&#8217;m involved with at work is coming up at the end of July. So, the way it looks right now, starting August I&#8217;m on my extended break. Interesting enough, the next 72 hour compo kicks off friday the 29th. Ain&#8217;t that convenient? <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />
