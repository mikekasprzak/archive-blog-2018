Just a bunch of scattered Arduino notes.

## Leonardo

  * All data pins can be Digital Inputs or Outputs (i.e. D0-D13, A0-A5). Thus, 20 digital I/O pins
  * Caveat: D0 and D1 are shared by the UART bus used to communicate over USB. So if you want to avoid reading/writing weird values while connected to the PC, you may want to avoid these pins.
  * Pins D3, D5, D6, D9-D11, D13 have PWM&#8217;s attached to one of 3 (4) timers.
  * Timer1 (OC1x) on D9-D11 is the &#8216;fanciest&#8217; timer. ðŸ˜‰
  * Pins A0-A5, as well as D4, D6, D8-10, D12 are all capable of Analog Input (not output)
  * To do analog out, use a PWM with some magic: https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/Analog-Output
  * Each set of pins is a block. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation
  * PORTD is D0-D7 (8 bits*, DDRD)
  * PORTB is D8-D13 (6 bits, DDRB)
  * PORTC is A0-A5 (6 bits, DDRC)

  * Set the DDRx registers directly to write bytes (i.e. `DDRD = B11111100;`). You can read them too, and mask-out the data you&#8217;re not using
  * B11001010 macros can be used for bitmasks, etc
  * PinMode(pin,mode) &#8211; mode can be INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP
  * INPUT_PULLUP not available on D0 and D1.
  * D0 and D1 are actually the same pins as SCL and SCA. On the board twice for some reason.
  * Standard 4 pins with support for interrupts D0-D3. Leonardo does actually have one more (D7)
  * Serial.print(), Serial.println() to output to the PC console over UART. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial

## Protocols

### UART

Has 1 channel. Not &#8216;true&#8217; UART, as true UART runs at 12v.

  * Uses Pins D0 and D1 (because of interrupts?). These pins also lack the optional pull-up resistors found on other Arduino pins.
  * 3 actual wires: TX, RX, GND. TX=Transmit, RX=Receive. Typically White, Green, Black
  * Data rate is typically 112 kHz (115200), but could be double that (230400)
  * Is technically &#8220;Full Duplex&#8221; because of the separate Transmit and Receive lines
  * Serial UART is an asynchronous protocol, **WITHOUT** a transmitted clock.
  * Devices must agree upon the data rate ahead of time, and must run their own perfectly sync&#8217;d clocks.
  * Primarily limited to communication between 2 devices. In theory multiple is possible, but it&#8217;s just not practical.

### 1-Wire

For that temperature sensor (DS18B20).

  * Uses ??

http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire

### I2C/TWI (2-Wire)

For a variety of breakout chips. 16bit ADC (ADS1115), DAC (MCP4725), 64k EEPROM (24LC512), 128k SRAM (23LC1024*), 16bit Digital I/O Expander (MCP23017).

Loosely related to SMBus. Some SMBus devices could work over I2C.

  * Uses D2 and D3 (because of interrupts)
  * 3 actual pins: SCL, SDA, GND. SCL=Clock, SDA=Data
  * [Open Drain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector), using 3-state logic (high, low, high-impedance).
  * Master/Slave(s). Technically it can have multiple masters, but the masters can&#8217;t directly talk to each-other over the bus (need to negotiate via another way).
  * Either 112 (7 bit w/ reserved) or ~1000 (10 bit) devices can be on the bus. Each needs a unique (often hardwired) ID. Chips often have extra pins you ground to set the unique ID to 1-or-more values, but it means you still have a limit of 2-8 instances of the same device on a bus.
  * Data rate is either 100 kHz, or 400 kHz. Later specs allow 1 MHz, 3.4 MHz and 5 MHz, but we don&#8217;t get to use those.
  * SCL and SDA have pull-up resistors, connected to the Master&#8217;s power. I.e. the default state is High.
  * Slaves ground the data line, to make the low signals. To go high, you leave it open.

### SPI (4-Wire)

For SD Cards, Flash Memory (W25Q80BV), 10bit ADC (MCP3008), &#8230;
