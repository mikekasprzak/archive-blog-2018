Crawling out of bed early this morning, I made the weird decision that it&#8217;d be a blogging morning. It seems I&#8217;ve stockpiled a few interesting things to talk about. I&#8217;m nearly ready to start talking about the new project too, but as the title suggests, I&#8217;ll be talking about _the other stuff_ today.

First thing on the agenda, Ludum Dare. I wanted to follow up that prior post of mine with a brief finale post. Wednesday night I flipped the switch and revealed the results to Ludum Dare 14, our biggest competition yet. Amazingly, we missed only 2 entries the night of the competition. So the final total was 123 entries. Wow!

Rather than repeat all the subtle details, you can check out my [news post on the ludumdare.com](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/05/06/ludum-dare-14-results-now-available/). Notable extras include [18 time-lapse videos](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/05/06/ludum-dare-14-time-lapse-videos/), 2 of those being fully produced episodes of an internet video show by one of our regulars/admins. It&#8217;s very cool to see what interesting ways our community and event have evolved over the past 7 years.

Ludum Dare got a mention on [Game Set Watch](http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/05/ludum_dare_14_results_top_scor.php). Also [a few](http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_portwall_ld.html) [entries](http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_you_got_a_d.html) [were](http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_mind_wall_s.html) [noted](http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_tombed_aunt.html) on IndieGames.com, and via a syndicated article on [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23338).

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

Next on the agenda, book. I hinted at this earlier in the year. On and off over the past few months, I wrote a chapter for an iPhone Game Development book. I sent what might be my final edits about a week ago, so I might be done now. Before spilling the beans about the project, I wanted to see the book on Amazon first.

And&#8230; well&#8230; guess what?

The book is a collection of articles written by iPhone game developers. It&#8217;s _almost_ like a Game Programming Gems for iPhone, with 10 articles in total.

The book has an interesting motif. It&#8217;s written from the perspective of _&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m an iPhone game developer, and I made this game. Here&#8217;s something interesting I did in my game, and how I did it&#8221;_.

I&#8217;m not sure I can say what the other authors wrote, but I will say I wrote a chapter on portability. I&#8217;ve mentioned here a few times already, but Smiles was developed mostly on Windows. I built a custom library that wrapped SDL+OpenGL for PC/Linux ports, and iPhone OS+OpenGL ES for the iPhone port. In my chapter I walk through some pros/cons of working portably, and talk about what and how you need to work in order for the code to be easily portable. I finish off with a neat little physics demo-game that&#8217;ll compile and run on any SDL supported platform, and the iPhone (native iPhone code, not the SDL port).

I&#8217;ll have more to say about my thoughts on the writing process another time. I want to hold a finished printed copy of the book in my hand first. ðŸ™‚

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

Finally, [Gavin Bowman](http://www.antairgames.com/blog/) (one of my twitter cohorts) started a _feature_ for The Apple Blog called [The App Store Round-table](http://theappleblog.com/tag/app-store-roundtable/). There&#8217;s a group of iPhone developers commenting on subjects on a mailing list, and Gavin assembles an article with notable quips from that discussion. Anyways, things I&#8217;ve said have come up twice. ðŸ˜‰

&#8211; [The Gold Rush](http://theappleblog.com/2009/04/29/app-store-roundtable-the-gold-rush/)
  
&#8211; [Transparency and the Approval System](http://theappleblog.com/2009/05/06/app-store-roundtable-transparency-and-the-approval-system/)

Both comments are actually from a response back when he pitched us the idea a few months ago, so maybe they&#8217;re not the most up to date (yet). Still, I think it&#8217;s a neat project to be involved in. Plus The iPhone Blog [spoke highly of Smiles](http://theappleblog.com/2008/12/03/smiles-who-you-lookin-at/), which is always an easy to make me like you. ðŸ˜€

That&#8217;s it for now. I have a little more work I&#8217;d like to do on &#8220;the new project&#8221; before I start spilling all the details. Until then.
