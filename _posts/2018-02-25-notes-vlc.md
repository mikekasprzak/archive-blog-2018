Under **View->Add Interface**, you can enable the Web Interface for VLC. This gives you a way to remote control VLC using HTTP requests, or simply check the status of things (like the currently playing song).

By default, the web server runs here:

<http://localhost:8080/>

Before you can access it, you need to set a password. Follow the instructions at the URL above (i.e. **Tools->Preferences** then **All->Interface->Main Interface->Lua** then **Lua HTTP->Password**.

With a password set, you can access it via cURL like so:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >curl http://localhost:8080/requests/status.json -u :mypassword</pre>

Noting that you have a password, and no login. To connect via other means (i.e. the browser), you&#8217;ll have to open a connection using Basic Authentication. You can find details about the HTTP headers necessary to do this in the [example found here](https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/9671) (last item).

Useful links:

  * <http://localhost:8080/requests/>
  * <http://localhost:8080/requests/README.txt>
  * <http://localhost:8080/requests/status.json>
  * <http://localhost:8080/requests/playlist.json>

To **permanently** enable the web server when VLC is running, go to **Tools->Preferences**, then select **All->Interface->Main Interface**. Under **Extra interface modules** you can select **Web**. When you restart and check **View->Add Interface** it wont show up, but the server is running.
