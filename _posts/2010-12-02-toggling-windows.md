Added a toggle button for Windowed and Fullscreen today, and made it actually work. I also did some tweaking of the icons around the edge of the screen (pushed them higher, made the outlines more consistent).

<div id="attachment_3576" style="max-width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/WindowMaximize1.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/WindowMaximize1-640x370.jpg" alt="" title="WindowMaximize" width="640" height="370" class="size-large wp-image-3576" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/WindowMaximize1-640x370.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/12/WindowMaximize1-450x260.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    One of these days I need to align the outside UI stuffs to the edge of the screen
  </p>
</div>

The About/Credits screen icon is now a speech bubble (was a &#8220;?&#8221;, so not to confuse it with the help menu). Just a few more tweaks to go before I dive in to Android.
