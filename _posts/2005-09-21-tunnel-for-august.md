<img src='/content/pbbannertease.gif' alt='guh?' align="right" />The [round up](http://www.gametunnel.com/html/section-viewarticle-128.html) is here. Hurah.

An underwater sequel to Cosmo Bots, a mech 3D shooter War World, Diablo meets Gauntlet in Evil Invasion, and a double dose of cavemen. An alright month. We&#8217;ve had better.

But wait! What is this? Bright red, black, orange and blue banners? Oh noes! What could this be? An add campaign for some wacky game? Inconceivable!
