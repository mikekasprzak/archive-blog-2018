For the benefit of friends and people I&#8217;m meeting at the show, here&#8217;s a run down of my itinerary for GDC. I&#8217;ll also be [tweeting](http://twitter.com/mikekasprzak) and watching twitter while I&#8217;m down for any impromptu meets, hang-outs, and whatever with people I know. If the twitter says &#8220;totally bored&#8221;, then you know. ðŸ™‚

If anybody I know needs my cell number, send me a quick e-mail (mike AT sykhronics dot com). It&#8217;s not my usual cell, but it&#8217;ll be my number whilst I&#8217;m in San Fran.
