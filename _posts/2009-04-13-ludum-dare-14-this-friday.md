Just a quick note.

[**Ludum Dare 14**](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) is this Friday. It&#8217;s usually [Phil](http://www.galcon.com) and I that run the compo (with [Mike](http://www.hamumu.com) and [Seth](http://www.codedojo.com), and our awesome community of regulars), but _IGF Champion_ and _Goat Owner Extreme_ Phil Hassey is off on his _North American Tour_ next week, leaving me to see if I can remember how to use all his compo scripts. ðŸ˜‰

If you&#8217;re not familiar with [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/), we&#8217;re probably the oldest _make a game in 48 hours_ competitions on the internet. Started in 2002, as the number suggests, it&#8217;s our 14th full-on 48 hour competition. We&#8217;ve actually far run more than that (unofficial compos as they were called), even a 24 hour compo originally (AKA. Ludum Dare Zero).

Since this time last year, as a community we&#8217;ve been providing a new theme every off month. We bumped our schedule up to 3 compos a year (every April, August and December). We also have an extremely active community, that tends to either spontaneously make things, or run mini-compos and drawing competitions on occasion. You can catch all the action in **#ludumdare** on [irc.afternet.org](http://www.afternet.org).

All this week is Theme voting. We&#8217;ve been collecting themes since last month, and now is the chance for the community to sort through them.

There&#8217;s a new poll each day, and on Friday I assemble a list of the highest voted themes throughout the week for the final vote. Then Friday night, we begin.

Tune in to the website Friday night to catch April&#8217;s theme.
