I&#8217;m in the middle of&#8230; well&#8230; an insane amount of stuff. The WordPress update botched my layout (forgot to copy the default theme), so I decided to break it even more. ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;ll be writing up a full feature/retrospective for Ludum Dare 15 likely today. [Results are up](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/), and we&#8217;ve got some bragging to do. ðŸ™‚

I also have a big announcement to make soon (in a few weeks, month or so). Not sure exactly when I&#8217;ll make it, but it&#8217;s a big deal. I have something else I&#8217;m trying to get going, so the announcement might get grouped in to that.

Whoa&#8230; what is this? Me being vague? That&#8217;s unheard of!

Back soon. ðŸ˜€
