EDIT: Final version is over here:

This is a story.

Near the end of 2014, I started researching how to makes stuff for Commodore 64. This is something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a **very** long time. The Commodore was the computer I grew up with as a kid, but as a kid, I only ever wrote some lousy BASIC programs on it. I never made anything that truly utilized the hardware.

Then I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe1-VVXIEh4), and there was no turning back.

After figuring out how to get code running on a C64, I decided to set a goal for myself. Since the Commodore was the gaming machine of my youth, I decided: In the final days of 2014, I would create a small game based on something I wanted to make as a kid.

After digging through my sketches, doodles, and notes, I chose to do something with these:

This was me from the early 1990&#8217;s, probably 11 or 12 years old. I used to draw pixel art and game maps on graph paper (I used to paint them on my Commodore 64 too, but I don&#8217;t have backups).

In the 20+ years since then, I&#8217;ve learned a thing or two about drawing. I&#8217;m not great, but I have improved. So I decided to re-create the character.

Using some of the excellent free tools available for Commodore 64 dev, I made sprites.

After a bunch of work, I got this running in an emulator.

Before finally getting it running on an actual Commodore 64.

(NOTE: I stole the SID music file, but it&#8217;s playing for real on the C64)

At the end of the day, there wasn&#8217;t really much of a game there, but I was very proud to have finally make something that ran on the Commodore 64.

Want to hear something interesting? I wasn&#8217;t the only one.

A couple friends on Twitter were also playing with little retro projects.

[Ryan](http://twitter.com/rje) made a game run on the Nintendo Famicom (NES).

As you can see, we were sharing Vines of our progress while we made them. It was pretty cool. ðŸ˜€

I think we might be doing something like this again (I know I am). ðŸ™‚

Me, for 2015, I&#8217;m planning to dabbling with hardware this year. 

Some weeks back I ordered some old sound chips such as the Commodore 64&#8217;s SID (6581), Yamaha YM2612 (Sega Genesis/Mega Drive), and an AY-3 (other). I&#8217;m going to try directly interfacing with those sound chips using either an Arduino or Raspberry Pi (still deciding).

I ordered them via [AliExpress](http://aliexpress.com), which means China, which means shipping can take a month+ to get to me. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m bringing this story up now, a good month+ in advance, so you too can make preparations.

This isn&#8217;t a Ludum Dare, or an announcement for a new Game Jam. This is merely an invitation. Maybe you too have a few spare days before the year ends to do something. I usually have a few just after Xmas and Boxing Day, so I&#8217;ll be doing something then. 

I suggested to the guys that we should come up with a common hashtag (not sure what it should be yet). That way, it&#8217;s easier to find the stuff we&#8217;ve been up to. Photos, Videos, Vines. 

You&#8217;re welcome to join us. ðŸ™‚
