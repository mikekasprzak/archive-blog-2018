Yup, I&#8217;m a few days behind mentioning this, but this month&#8217;s [round up](http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=467) is up. A personal favorite of mine, Titan Attacks reigned supreme, followed by the slick steam powered airship game, Steam Brigade, and the un-noted but equally as surprisingly quality Inlay clone, Mosaic: Tomb of Mystery. Fun stuff.

As expected, I&#8217;m going to say things are going well with the game, despite the updates. Actually, better than well. Much Biz oriented stuff, which I&#8217;m going to have to sit on for a while. Very exciting.

Playing it is certainly a treat. The controls are a little tricky, since these things have a mind of their own. Some high speed glitches I&#8217;ve been fighting with physics wise, I&#8217;m surprised to see, actually show up in this game. I&#8217;m starting to suspect I&#8217;m just too anal for my own good. I think the art style is awesome, but I&#8217;m weird like that. Oh, and did I mention, _they_ sing?
