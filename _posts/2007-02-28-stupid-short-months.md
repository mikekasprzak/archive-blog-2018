Sitting in the home office, doing taxes. I came to the realization that the it&#8217;s one of those silly short February&#8217;s, and I hadn&#8217;t posted anything this month. I&#8217;ve been doing good as far as posts, with at least 1 thing to say every month. It&#8217;d be a shame to break that nice consistent list of dates on the right.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />

Job postings work. We found somebody that seems perfect for the job below. Just waiting on paperwork.

My PC wasn&#8217;t playing nice with DRM&#8217;d software (Audition, Colossus, &#8230;). I was also having odd issues with my DVD Burner, and my HP scanner was too fat (physically, and driver wise&#8230; 200 MB for a driver!?!).

I&#8217;m declaring it. That&#8217;s the last ASUS and HP product I buy.

So a couple weeks back, I went from a dual core Athlon, to a Quad core Intel. And instead of an ASUS, I went with an eVGA board. It&#8217;s an NVidia spec board, no stupid ASUS thinking they&#8217;re better designers garbage. Also, a USB powered Canon scanner. Ahh&#8230; the driver is a nice light 11 MB. Yes, 11 MB is &#8220;light&#8221; by today&#8217;s standards.

Also, of some interest, I&#8217;m now running Windows XP 64. Short of some printer problems, and MinGW&#8217;s BASH not working, it&#8217;s great. For the next month or so, you can buy a Windows XP and get a &#8230; uh &#8230; somewhat free upgrade to Vista. A $30 shipping style free upgrade, but it&#8217;s something. And yes, 64bit Windows XP gets you Vista 64 Biz. I&#8217;ll be waiting on installing it for a while, since not all my software is Vista friendly yet. 

Oh and speaking of printer problems, while looking for replacement toner, I noticed it was actually cheaper to buy a new laser printer than to buy the toner ($99 printer, $105 toner). However, Future Shop&#8217;s lovely website had some refurbished Network Color Laser&#8217;s on for $250 ($300 off). What was I to do?  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />

Yikes. Konica Minolta 5430 DL.

I kinda wish it had a duplexer, but that stupid page flipping device costs over $300. That&#8217;s more than I paid for the printer! It also takes DIMM socketed memories, so we nearly upgraded it, though it didn&#8217;t like the PC-100, PC-133 and other sticks I had sitting around. A shame. It works beautifully with XP 64.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

On topic, we put together a trailer/presentation, and playable last month, for &#8220;I wont say what&#8221;.

I suppose there was also some really crappy family news, but I wont go in to that. I am happy though, she got to see the trailer/presentation before she passed.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />

The next few months should be big. Stay tuned. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />
