Not much to say&#8230; okay, maybe there is, but I don&#8217;t want dwell on it.

A random work in progress shot, showing the result of terrain generation, and an imported 3D model. No, this isn&#8217;t a game, just showing that I&#8217;m working with some 3D stuff right now.

<div id="attachment_2885" style="max-width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Foundation14.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Foundation14-640x455.png" alt="" title="Foundation14" width="640" height="455" class="size-large wp-image-2885" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Foundation14-640x455.png 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Foundation14-450x320.png 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Foundation14.png 749w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>

</div>

I&#8217;m back working on some Smiles stuff again right now, which I&#8217;ll post about in the coming days as I finish. Plus, Ludum Dare 18 is next month, so I have some work to do there as well.

Busy busy.
