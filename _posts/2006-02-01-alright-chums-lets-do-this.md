<img src='/content/sophistication.gif' alt='It\&#39;s just crazy enough to work' align="right" />February the 1st. I&#8217;m mere minutes away from missing this chance to post and make the first of this month, yet I prevail. Ha ha!

Hopefully, I&#8217;m finally getting my act together. We&#8217;re already a month in to 2006, and really I haven&#8217;t had much to show. It seems I&#8217;ve been in a less than ideal situation up until recently. It&#8217;s resolution was equally as not so idealistic, so excuse me as I be vague, until the day we all look back and laugh about it. Har har. And as much as I \*love\* big vaporware plans, I plan not to be one. So here we are, starting the month out right.

I&#8217;m in the middle of writing up a little introduction as to what is going on around here in Sykoland. So yes, in fact, I&#8217;m just delaying you with insightful commentary as I type amazing things, and better grasp what&#8217;s really going on. Boy do I have some fly tales of developin&#8217; to be&#8217;all tellin&#8217; youz &#8217;bout soon. Yee!

Last waste post, I promise. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
