Cream soda kung fu presents, part 6:

## The Epic Tales of Hypocrisyism

So, right now, the current evolution of the character is this said goo blob thing. It shoots these tentacles/appendages out and swings, like any good monkey should.

However, for as long as I&#8217;ve been thinking about going with a gooey character, I&#8217;d been concerned about the [Gishness](http://www.gishgame.com) factor. This &#8220;factor&#8221; is what I&#8217;m calling all the references to Gish. Comments like &#8220;reminds me of Gish&#8221;, &#8220;very Gish like&#8221;, or &#8220;gross, there&#8217;s Gish in my coffee&#8221;. To test this theory (and to indulge in positive commentary), I shared a gameplay video with several friends. But despite its complete lack of hard/soft/sticky gameplay, the Gishness comments were there. Damn. How appropriate though, given I poked fun at another [Gishlike experience](/archives/52), back in the early days of this blog. Good job Mike. The gold star of suck is yours. Still, I&#8217;d be getting those references even if I went with a spider character.

Moving on.

But there is a reason I&#8217;m sticking with the dynamic gooey character idea. The best part about random goo entities, is they **totally** make sense to have unexplained things growing out of it, not just tentacles.

Well, &#8220;totally&#8221; is pushing it, but it&#8217;s ether goo or a magical tire&#8230; or perhaps a magical orange. But they don&#8217;t make as much sense, that is, without the over use of &#8220;magic&#8221; as the explanation. Magic limbs, magic trees, magic game crashes. No bugs here, just magic features.

But hey, it&#8217;s still early development, and nothing is really finalized. I&#8217;m currently working on establishing the art style, so more artful thing should pop up in the next few weeks.

Or maybe. Just maybe, I&#8217;ll find what the game really needs is a potato character that lacks self confidence.

Stay tuned for the finale, as I get us technically up to date in: Part 7, _a Sunset in Stone_.
