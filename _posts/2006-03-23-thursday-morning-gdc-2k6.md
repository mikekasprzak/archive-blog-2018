Thursday, another big day at the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com). 

Yesterday had some good events. The [IGF](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8643) results were announced, and the evil forces of [Darwinia](http://www.darwinia.co.uk) ran away with most of the prize money. Curse you Darwinia, I will have my revenge! Sony also spilled the beans, announcing [a service &#8220;like&#8221; Xbox Live Arcade](http://crystaltips.typepad.com/wonderland/2006/03/gdc_phil_harris.html), but neglects to invite Indie&#8217;s. How rude. And everyone&#8217;s talking about [Duke Nukem Forever **2**](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/pc/scott-miller-hypothesizes-duke-nukem-forever-2-162186.php).

It&#8217;ll be tough to beat a day as grand as yesterday, but today is always looking for a challenge. Go Today! You Rule! With talks from that Nintendo guy, and Will &#8220;_The kids used to call me Spore, the game is named after me_&#8221; Wright, it should be exciting.

Oh by the way, I&#8217;m not actually in San Jose, or anywhere near California for that matter. You should feel very foolish if you browsed over this post looking at pictures and assuming I actually attended this year. Thank you whomever I lifted that photo from. 

I&#8217;m actually sitting comfortably at my desk, pretending to be working on a game. So to _emulate_ the experience of being at GDC, I decided to go out for some breakfast. Mmm.

You see, part of a balanced game development diet requires junk food, especially during crunch times. Seeing how I have properly stocked kitchen handy, I&#8217;ve been falling behind on my quota. So we paid a visit to our fast food friend (at least he&#8217;s a friend when there&#8217;s not noisy kids around), [Dan](http://www.rainfallstudios.com/) McDonald&#8217;s.

Ahh&#8230; McDonald&#8217;s breakfast. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s inside.

Oh no! A half eaten syrup soaked bacon egg sandwich! Curse you Ronald!

Bleah, so I go for the orange juice.

Hey, hold on. Somethings not right.

Wait&#8230; this doesn&#8217;t taste like orange juice!
