2011 is here! The IGF finalists have been announced, CES is upon us, and GDC is less than 2 months away. I always have a hard time following up epic posts like the last one. So with this, my third attempt (ahem), I&#8217;m going to try to be more to the point: My plans for the year.

First, the Mac App Store launches on Thursday&#8230; I wonder if Mike did something for that? ðŸ˜‰

This month I&#8217;m aiming finish up the last of the &#8220;non console&#8221; ports. My long overdue Android port slipped well past December, but at least my PC versions are done (just waiting on distributors). Pending some spontaneous slacking, I should start rolling out Android ports in the coming weeks. Aside from that, there&#8217;s 1 more phone port I have left to do, and a not-phone port I&#8217;d _really_ like to finish.

February, later in the month, I have a long overdue iOS update I&#8217;m planning. More than anything, I&#8217;m tired of attending conferences (GDC) where the device in my pocket (an iPod touch) lacks the latest and greatest version of the game (iPad has it, but doesn&#8217;t fit in my pocket). So yes, I have some sort of universal agenda on the cards, but we see which way I go.

Before that though, and assuming my January ports don&#8217;t cannibalize all of February, I&#8217;ll be spending some time on my new game. This past Ludum Dare, I took the weekend finally start a gameplay prototype of this game. I didn&#8217;t get too far, but my hope is to spend the month of February getting the basic game mechanics working, just so I have something with me at the Conference (I&#8217;ve been muttering far too long about this new game without anything to show).

Once I get back in March, and for the entirety of April&#8230; lets just call this period of time &#8220;console ports&#8221;. I&#8217;ve been putting these off far too long; It&#8217;s a shame submissions and approvals are so much more complicated (and costly) on consoles, but oh well.

And if all goes according to plan, starting in May, I&#8217;ll be focusing most of my time on the new game.

It&#8217;s a heavy amount of Smiles work for early in the year, but I am expecting the new game to take a while. I have some pretty crazy ambitions for this new game. My hope is to make IGF submission with a polished vertical slice and memorable teaser trailer. The new game wont be finished this year, and will be a major departure from Smiles and my prior games. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have more rants and raves about it in the coming months.

So Mike, what will you be doing?

I&#8217;ll be working to convince you that this is a game you **must** play:

    I intentionally chose the ugliest recent screenshot, so when it finally starts looking good, we can A/B it showing how much better it looks. Mmmm... Yellow circle on green terrain.

For now, back to porting.
