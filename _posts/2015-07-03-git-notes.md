Just some notes. Recently, I had to merge and organize 3 repositories as one, so here are the things I ended up doing.

## Merging 2 repositories in to one with full history

<pre>cd path/to/project-b
git remote add project-a path/to/project-a
git fetch project-a
git merge project-a/master # or whichever branch you want to merge</pre>

In my case, the local repository (source) was **project-a**, and the public repository (destination) was **project-b**.

When I was finished merging, instead of `git push -u` I had to push it like so:

<pre>git push --set-upstream origin master</pre>

(where master was the branch I was targeting)

## Accepting all merged changes

After doing the above, my repository was filled with conflicts. I didn&#8217;t care about the the remote changes, so I was able to just blanket accept my local changes.

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >git checkout --ours -- &lt;paths&gt;
# or
git checkout --theirs -- &lt;paths&gt;</pre>

In the above context, project-b (destination) is `--ours`, and project-a is `--theirs`. I used `--theirs`, as I wanted my local repository merged in to the public one.

## Adding an empty branch

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >git checkout --orphan NEW_BRANCH_NAME
git rm -rf .</pre>

Now add/commit any change to keep it.

## Adding Multiple Origins

I haven&#8217;t done this yet, but eventually I&#8217;ll need to push code in to two separate repositories on demand.

## Reverting a commit

Say you make a bad commit. You can revert the changes like so.

<pre>git revert --no-commit 0766c053..HEAD
git commit
</pre>

Source: <http://stackoverflow.com/a/21718540>

Just look-up the version ID of the commit you want instead, and edit it in to the above command.

## Discarding changes

To discard a change, re-checkout the file.

<pre>git checkout path/to/file/to/revert
</pre>

Source: <http://stackoverflow.com/a/52713>

For &#8216;all unstaged files&#8217; (everything??).

<pre>git checkout -- .
</pre>
