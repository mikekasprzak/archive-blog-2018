Progress on the tech for my upcoming game &#8220;Alone, The&#8221; has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com), a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT&#8217;S RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:

> ### TransGaming Announces Winner of the $10,000 GameTree Developer Competition: Developer&#8217;s Choice Award
> 
> Developers from around the world have their say: Smiles HD takes home the prize
> 
> **TORONTO, CANADA – August 31, 2011** – TransGaming Inc. (TSX-V:TNG), the global leader in the multiplatform deployment of games, today announced Smiles HD by Sykhronics Entertainment as the winner of their GameTree Developer Competition: Developer&#8217;s Choice Award.
> 
> Smiles HD is an award-winning puzzle/matching game featuring inventive game modes, engaging achievements and family-friendly themes. This immersive but &#8220;snackable&#8221; game experience involves spinning, swapping and dropping smiling objects to create huge combos and even bigger scores. After incredible commercial and critical success on the iPhone and iPad, Smiles HD was easily enabled on the next generation GameTree TV gaming platform for Smart TV.
> 
> “The amazing opportunity presented by TransGaming’s GameTree Developer Competition allows an independent developer such as myself to easily reach a growing market on an exciting new platform”, said Michael Kasprzak of Sykhronics Entertainment. “With TransGaming&#8217;s help and the GameTree TV SDK, Smiles HD was enabled on GameTree TV in a matter of hours.”
> 
> “We wanted our GameTree Developer Competition to truly engage the talented independent game development community in order to be able to discover and deliver innovative and creative interactive entertainment to our GameTree TV consumers. The Developer&#8217;s Choice Award gave GameTree Developers a voice to choose the best among their peers”, commented Vikas Gupta, CEO and President of TransGaming. “This indie development community is creating revolutionary games like Smiles HD which we know will be enjoyed by the GameTree TV audience, and TransGaming is dedicated to finding and rewarding that talent.”

I am a big fan of the outcome. 😀

Smiles HD should go live on &#8220;Free&#8221; set-top boxes in France soon.
