<img src='/content/xmashatguys.gif' alt='My hat is huge, and so is my hate' align="right" />Yes, it is certainly a newer year than before, and yet, I&#8217;m 3 weeks behind in declaring it as such. Ahh, this whole time thing you corporeal types take for granola.

I&#8217;m busy getting things in order on this side of screen. Big year, lots to do. Many [sites](http://www.sykhronics.com) [that](http://www.mikekasprzak.com) [need](http://www.toonormal.com) [work](http://www.puffbomb.com), and a game development crunch to kick off soon. Stay tuned. Check back every minute. &#8216;cmon, show my host how much you love it.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

Round up is coming at you soon, my bad for it&#8217;s lateness.
