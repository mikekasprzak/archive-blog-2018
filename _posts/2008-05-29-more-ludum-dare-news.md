I was really hoping to show what I&#8217;ve been up to these past couple months right about now, but it looks like that tease will have wait a few more weeks.

Something that is ready to go, albeit beta like, is the new Ludum Dare website.

<http://www.ludumdare.com>

The WordPress blog we&#8217;ve used for the last 2 compos has been migrated to dedicated hosting, and the ludumdare.com domain now points to it directly. You can check out the new hub website at the link above, and read up on all the latest happenings.

Next weekend (June 6th), we&#8217;re also having our first Mini LD Compo. This is a variant of the &#8220;non competitions&#8221; we&#8217;ve hosted in the past. If all goes according to plan, these will become monthly between the major community voted/judged compos. Any veteran Ludum Dare entrant can opt to host a compo. They can choose to provide a theme, and make changes/tweaks to the process. Mini LD&#8217;s are still a new idea, and we&#8217;ll be evolving what they mean throughout their lifetime.

Since it was his idea, Mike (Hamumu) Hommel will be hosting the first one.

Tune in Friday June 6th for the theme announcement.

And if everything goes according to plan, we should be announcing an August 2008 date for Ludum Dare 12. We&#8217;re going to try our hand at Mini LD #1 first, to see how the new site handles it.
