**London, Ontario, Canada** &#8211; **November 12th, 2008**

**Sykhronics Entertainment** would like to introduce, **Smiles**. A brand new game now available for **iPhone** and **iPod touch**.

**Smiles** is a collection of 2 great games.

**Smiles Drop** is an unconventional action puzzle game. Unlike many others, you don&#8217;t have to wait to make your next move. In addition, you&#8217;re not pressured in to making that move either. Play at your own pace. Make matches, break ice and rocks, twisting and turning your way to higher scores.

**Smiles Zen** is a relaxing game of strategy. Borrowing heavily from Solitaire and Sudoku, it&#8217;s an easy game to pick up but difficult to master. Matches light up instead of clearing, and the goal is to light up the board.

In addition to difficulties, **Smiles** features several extra game modes. **Avalanche**, where the ice constantly pours out; **Hard**, where ice is harder to break; **Long Play**, where multiple matches and combos are easier; And **Six**, where you can lose in as few as 2 moves.

**Features:**
  
• 2 great games (Smiles Drop, and Smiles Zen)
  
• 14 different game modes
