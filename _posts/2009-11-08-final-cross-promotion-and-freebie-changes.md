As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn&#8217;t realize you could click on the icon. Here&#8217;s a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.

<div id="attachment_1442" style="max-width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the &#8220;love hearts&#8221;, so I made a similar change to free version.

<div id="attachment_1443" style="max-width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SupportMe02.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SupportMe02-450x313.jpg" alt="Free Smiles, now with more LOVE." title="SupportMe02" width="450" height="313" class="size-medium wp-image-1443" srcset="http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SupportMe02-450x313.jpg 450w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SupportMe02.jpg 966w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Free Smiles, now with more LOVE.

</div>

Also now, the &#8220;support the developer!&#8221; starburst takes the place of the music instructions. It works just like clicking on the Smiles icon does (brings up a popup confirming that you want to open the store). And for fun, all the popups play the &#8220;Woo Hoo!&#8221; sound like the Zen and Drop cross promotion does. For the free version only, I&#8217;ll be making clicking &#8220;no&#8221; play the &#8220;Aww!&#8221; sound, as there&#8217;s really no other place to fit that in.

My hope is to be finished integrating the 1.3 updates and testing by noon Sunday (i.e. today). I&#8217;ve actually been up since 1:30 AM, which is one of the perks of being self employed (your hours don&#8217;t have to make sense).

Monday I&#8217;m hoping to be back on the PC version of Smiles. I&#8217;d like a release candidate finished before the end of the month, so I can iron out the distribution plans.

EDIT: Free Smiles 1.3 sent to Apple. That&#8217;s all of them.
