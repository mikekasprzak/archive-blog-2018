I figure there&#8217;s no reason _not_ to share these.

**Smiles Zen**&#8216;s &#8220;FREE ZEN WEEKEND&#8221; download statistics:

> **1022** &#8211; Thursday October 29th (started at noon)
  
> **3544** &#8211; Friday October 30th
  
> **1826** &#8211; Saturday October 31st
  
> **1361** &#8211; Sunday November 1st
  
> **144** &#8211; Monday November 2nd (ended at 1 AM)

The 29th was a fraction of a day. I flipped the switch roughly around noon, which kicked in about 4 hours later. The 30th is the actual 1 year anniversary.

So far that puts the total at 7900 free downloads of Smiles Zen. I turned the sale off at 1 AM on the 1st (making it the 2nd technically), so it&#8217;s possible several more freebies snuck in (EDIT: updated figures).

So did sales improve? Um, a little, but nothing worth bragging about. The hope now is that I can turn the 1.3 update in to a cross promotion for **Smiles Drop**. That&#8217;s nearly 8000 people I didn&#8217;t have access to before, which is always nice to have.
