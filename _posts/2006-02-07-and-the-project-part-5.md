Hey there sports fans. Our epic saga continues with part 5:

## The Character

###### (or I&#8217;m a little tea pot why are you reading this sub heading like I have something insightful to say e-i-e-i-o)

Last we left our hero, he was an eight legged insect. Now he&#8217;s an eight legged insect looking for a job!!!

Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, he&#8217;s not a bad guy. You see, it&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to work out between us. I&#8217;ve met someone.

As suggested, I&#8217;ve de-evolved the spider. Eight legs and webbing is just a bit more detailed of a character than I want to make here. So that means I want to simplify the character. Combine the concept of legs and webbing into a single idea. Of course, that can mean only one thing.

## Tentamar! The smiling tentacle monster!

Alright, no. Not Tentamar.

Actually, the character I&#8217;m leaning towards is nameless, just like the game. I&#8217;m assuming the name of the character and the name of the game will share some elements in common.

So anyways, as before, a bunch of random design ideas. Some of the multi-eye monsters you see here were early concepts for a sort of multiplayer monstrosity.

And the result of it all, something embarrassingly familiar.

A goo ball.

Tune in next time for part 6, _The Epic Tales of Hypocrisyism_.
