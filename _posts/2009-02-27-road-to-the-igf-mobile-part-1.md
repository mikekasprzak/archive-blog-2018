Yet another _series_, but video.

Part 1 of hopefully a few videos of me showing off my IGF preparations. Sinage, computers, etc.

3 weeks left and counting.



A bit roughly put together, but that&#8217;s half the point. I didn&#8217;t want it to eat up that much time, though it did take me some time to remember how to edit and encode a video (without my software crashing).

It&#8217;s no [Goo Road to the IGF](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF4uIKDqI7w), but hey.

Enjoy. ðŸ™‚
