I&#8217;ll get back to the series eventually. I was expecting to work and talk about new engine stuffs. Between some spontaneous stuff, taxes, and a week of illness, I&#8217;ve not touched anything &#8220;next&#8221; since early last month.

In other news, [Ludum Dare 11](http://www.imitationpickles.org/ludum/) is this Friday. I&#8217;ve been too busy to really get involved, but [Phil&#8217;s](http://www.philhassey.com/blog/) got things under control. Notice went out to the [mailing list](http://www.gamecompo.com/mailing-list/) a good month or so early, and I&#8217;ve been mirroring the posts on a very default looking [gamecompo.com](http://www.gamecompo.com/) blog. I mention that because it has an [RSS feed](http://www.gamecompo.com/feed/), for those that&#8217;d prefer a feed over a mailing list.

I think there&#8217;s still a couple more days to [suggest themes](http://www.imitationpickles.org/ludum/wiki/ld11:themes), before they&#8217;re voted down to a minimal list.

Hit the [announcement](http://www.imitationpickles.org/ludum/2008/04/05/ld11-april-18-20-less-than-two-weeks-warning/) for more information.
