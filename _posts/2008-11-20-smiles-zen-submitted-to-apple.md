Part one of my rebellion against the iPhone price drop madness has begun. Smiles Zen, the standalone version of Zen is now sent to Apple.

If everything goes according to plan, it will be released bright and early Tuesday morning. This time, I explicitly set the date.

In other news, a new review.

OSX Reality &#8211; **4 Stars**. Incredibly favorable review. Their only beef was that they expect a price drop for it to be competitive. Well, as evidenced above, I&#8217;m trying something a little different.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
