Not much to say. I discovered an interesting feature I&#8217;m sure I knew, but always ignored in Paint Shop Pro. The wonderful world of layer masks. From an existing sketch we extract the line art as a mask, and can now do all kinds of fun coloring. We can fill in a whole layer with a color, apply the mask to only show color where the line art was, then color under on other layers to fill it in.

And here&#8217;s a doodle that I equally hate, and adore.

More sketches to follow, when I have the time.
