This past weekend I began a process of rebranding my company. Shortly after leaving my AAA job in 2005, I created this logo.

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SykLogo_Brown-450x83.png" alt="SykLogo_Brown" width="450" height="83" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5842" srcset="http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SykLogo_Brown-450x83.png 450w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SykLogo_Brown-640x118.png 640w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SykLogo_Brown.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SykLogo_Brown.png)

Thing is, that&#8217;s not even one of the better logos I used, it&#8217;s just the most business&#8217;y one.

[More here](/2005/11/27/classic-logos/). 

As you can see, I used to be really in to playing with typography. Sykhronics is a name I&#8217;ve been using for the past 15 years. In the early days, it was my portfolio website. When I decided to go &#8220;Fulltime Indie&#8221;, it became my business. It&#8217;s always been the hub of &#8220;me&#8221;; Whatever &#8220;me&#8221; is doing.

I&#8217;ve tried on [several ocassions](/2010/11/14/tales-of-a-silent-h/) to come up with something better, but it just hadn&#8217;t worked out.

Until now.

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogo7-640x237.png" alt="NewSykLogo7" width="640" height="237" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5840" srcset="http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogo7-640x237.png 640w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogo7-450x166.png 450w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogo7.png 1323w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogo7.png)

Yay! There we go! Lots of things going on here, but most importantly I was able to creatively satisfy my type design itch.

The process involved me going to twitter and asking a simple question: Read this, and what does it say? 

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogoWhite-450x72.png" alt="NewSykLogoWhite" width="450" height="72" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5848" srcset="http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogoWhite-450x72.png 450w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogoWhite-640x103.png 640w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogoWhite.png 1252w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogoWhite.png)

Some of the results were extremely amusing (SykBronies!? Ha!). So after several iterations, we ended up with the orange logo above. 

Notably absent is the H from Sykhronics. If you&#8217;ve never heard of Sykhronics, you&#8217;re probably asking &#8220;why was there an H there anyway?&#8221;. Well after some thought, lots of head tilting back and forth, I decided to try it without. I think &#8220;H less&#8221; SYKRONICS makes a lot of sense. The only downside is my own natural instinct typing it and reading it. My muscle memory for typing Sykhronics is so well developed, that I know when I&#8217;ve typed it wrong without even looking. Hey, that&#8217;s what happens after 15 years. ðŸ˜‰

Now the logo isn&#8217;t perfect. I&#8217;ve had several folks call out the K and the C for looking like &#8220;WTF&#8221; and E. I&#8217;m okay with that, because overall the design is consistent and interesting. 9 characters, all with hints of a circle in them, with sharp cuts.

Something I&#8217;ve wanted in the logo forever is a character. So part of the design is the O creature. It&#8217;s very much Pata Pon&#8217;esc, which I&#8217;m always a iffy about (looking too much like an existing franchise), but it&#8217;s fine. I like it. It&#8217;s interesting. Like a little floating eyeball with fangs. Gives me \*SOMETHING\* to use as a mascot, which I&#8217;ve always wanted.

Anyways, I&#8217;ve gone ahead and printed some biz cards. They look like this.

I&#8217;ve always been of the opinion that as a game developer, our business is fun, so we should be having fun everywhere. Hence why I went with such a bizarre job title (Formerly just &#8220;Game Developer, Owner&#8221;).

And that&#8217;s that. So far I&#8217;ve just started with the biz cards. After GDC I&#8217;ll make it the website too. Ta!
