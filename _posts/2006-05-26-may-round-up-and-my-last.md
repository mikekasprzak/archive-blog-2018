The [round up for may](http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=477) is up. Heh, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to be scolded by [Mike](http://www.hamumu.com) and [Seth](http://www.rtsoft.com) for not finding time to mention to them that this would be my last round up, but in a way, that&#8217;s half the reason why. Busy busy.

A hand full of interesting games this month. Eets, the TIM like game with the hungry mood swing guy; Bone: The Great Cow Race, a fine modern example of comic gone adventure game; Odyssey: Winds of Athena, the game with the water currents gameplay; and American History Lux, desensitizing gamers of war since 1754.

So there we have it. This month puts me just over a year and a half&#8217;s worth of round up&#8217;s. It&#8217;s been a great little research project. I&#8217;ve played a lot of interesting games I would have normally missed. It&#8217;s been a really great way to put the Indie and Casual games industry in to perspective.

And now, back to the grind. Just like last month/post suggested, things are busy. There was a bit of a significant project direction shift then, to better meet a quickly approaching deadline. I&#8217;m afraid this annoying &#8220;vague&#8221; tone is required for a month or two more. That, and I&#8217;d rather speak with images.
