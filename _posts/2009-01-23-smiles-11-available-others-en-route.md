As the topic suggests, **Smiles 1.1** is now available. **Smiles Zen** and **Smiles Drop 1.1** were sent earlier this morning, so they should be available in the coming days.

Made a minor [website](http://www.smiles-game.com) update, since I didn&#8217;t win the &#8220;Best Casual Game&#8221; award, and to point out I&#8217;m in IGF Mobile. IGFM finalists to be announced Monday.

One more little something for **Smiles**, then back to the scripture.
