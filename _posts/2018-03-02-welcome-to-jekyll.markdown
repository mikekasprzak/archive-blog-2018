Okay! I've migrated my blog to Jekyll (and GitHub).

I followed this tutorial: https://girliemac.com/blog/2013/12/27/wordpress-to-jekyll/

Notably since I ran a very old WordPress blog, I had to manually copy over all the images and things NOT found in the `/wp-content/` folder. This has made my tree a bit less organized (`/content/`, `/wp-includes/`) but at least it's all there.

Repo is here: https://github.com/mikekasprzak/blog

(not that anyone other than me cares)

# Welcome to Jekyll!

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
