Just got back from the grocery store, and got the word. &#8220;**Ready for Sale**&#8220;.

Search for &#8220;Smiles&#8221; and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.

Contrary to the description, it&#8217;s an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes &#8216;esc, or Bejeweled on crack.

Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it&#8217;s also what the description says. But that&#8217;s a topic all in itself.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

Great news, but the down side is I haven&#8217;t finished my press pack yet. Ack!

Hopefully I&#8217;ll have a video for tomorrow.
