Apparently I forgot about this. The [Slamdance Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition](http://www.slamdance.com/games/) is yet another IGF like compo. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s actually worth any prizes&#8230; at least none their publicizing. Either way, I&#8217;ve put together a publicity pack for them, and will be sending it off today. A shame that they&#8217;re making me pay to enter. Buh.

I think what turned me off about this &#8220;way back when&#8221; was that the game had to be profitless, but apparently that&#8217;s not the case anymore. I have a sneaky suspicion that perhaps there&#8217;s a 3rd compo I&#8217;m mistaking this one for though. Hmm&#8230; I&#8217;ll go check.
