As the name suggests, I finally upgraded my WordPress, and am now running it off my &#8220;personal&#8221; hosting (as opposed to the biz hosting).

Unfortunately, I was using a relatively ancient version (2.0.3) that lacks an export feature.  The best I&#8217;ve been able to do was import the RSS feed.  This means I lost all the comments (and my drafts).  Ah well.

So now after 3 years, it&#8217;s finally redesign time.  Fun fun.

Expect some site weirdness throughout the week. It took the nameservers all day Friday to renew for me.
