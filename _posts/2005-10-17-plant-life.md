<img src='/content/plantconcept.gif' alt='Plant Lady' align="right" />I&#8217;ve been trying to come up with a 3rd character to go along with the hamster and the robot for PuffBOMB. When I started redesigning the game, I wanted at least a male and a female character, but ended up with 2 males (3 if you count a butch hamster that I&#8217;d recently replaced with the robot).

It seems I have something. What you see to the right is a concept for the potted plant girl character. Yes, a potted plant. Oh, just imagine the hilarious conversations a Hamster, a Robot and a Female Potted Plant could have. Oh the hilarity! Not to mention, the unique dynamics of having a heavier sided character. Does this pot make me look fat?

As we can see, I &#8220;for some reason&#8221; went with a sort of swooshy shaped head thing, instead of the predictable 4 leaf flower. It&#8217;s madness I say. This Mike guy is out of control.

The round up should be up on the Tunnel soon. We&#8217;ve finally gone ahead and begun playing with the layout. Might be some imagry there too.
