Yep, it&#8217;s that time of month. Tell me, what&#8217;s [round, monthly and up](http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=445)? I shouldn&#8217;t have to answer that question.

A pretty light month. A slick little Final Fantasy&#8217;esc RPG, Aveyond. An adventure game with this big blue thing and a really long name, Frasse and the Peas of Kekick. Yes, that&#8217;s right. An undersea adventure, Joust revisited, a card game, and more at the [Tunnel](http://www.gametunnel.com).

Yeah, I&#8217;ve been quieter than I had hoped. It ends up I got back to coding, so I&#8217;ll talk about that once I finish my big shiny task.
