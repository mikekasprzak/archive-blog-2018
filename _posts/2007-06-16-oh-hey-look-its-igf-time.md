Wow, and yikes. Time flies. [IGF Submission time again](http://www.igf.com/). October 1st &#8216;eh? I should probably enter. ***shrug***

Here&#8217;s something interesting.

> The 2008 IGF Main Competition will again be open to all independent developers to submit their games &#8211; whether it be on PC, **console digital download**, Web browser, or other more exotic formats.

Cool, but doesn&#8217;t that have to mean your game is already available/to be available by October? Or are the big 3 giving kits to judges now? ***shrug***

The 10th IGF too. Wow. My game isn&#8217;t that cool. ***shrug***

Thanks for the heads up [Tim and his mighty Blog](http://indygamer.blogspot.com/2007/06/igf-submissions-open.html).
