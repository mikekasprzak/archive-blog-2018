So hey. I wrote and open sourced a small cross platform library for getting the IP and MAC address of the current device. You can find it here:

<https://github.com/povrazor/net-adapter>

So far I&#8217;ve tested it on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac OSX Mountain Lion. It **\*should\*** also work on iOS, BSD and Android. If you happen to test it on one of those other platforms, I would love to know what the Sample program outputs. Thanks!

EDIT (June 2015): Moved it to GitHub, merged in an Android fix.
