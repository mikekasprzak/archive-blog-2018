Well, more things I&#8217;m expecting to work but don&#8217;t.

  * Can&#8217;t Full-Screen a Flash Video, and multitask (the video de-full-screens upon click)
  * With multiple monitors, full-screening flash gets confused (doesn&#8217;t fill full screen)
  * Clicking an App Icon on Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t minimize ([by design](http://askubuntu.com/questions/36433/why-cant-i-use-the-unity-launcher-icon-to-minimize-applications-windows), but it&#8217;s stupid)
  * In some parts of Ubuntu, the Backspace key acts like a back key. In other places, it does not.
  * CTRL+Insert, SHIFT+Delete, SHIFT+Insert are not Copy, Cut, Pastes.
  * File Open/Save Dialogs lack things installed in Nautilus, such as my Mercurial Plugin (Tortoise Hg)
  * Nautilus (in Ubuntu 13.10 anyway), when you type stuff it does a system wide search instead of jumping to a file in a current directory (apparently this has been addressed for the upcoming Ubuntu 14.4).
  * Nautilus lacks a **nice** way to just type a file url (and copy them).

That is all (for now).
