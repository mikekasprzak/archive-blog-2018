Clock is ticking. 

Yep. In one sense, I&#8217;m ready to go. I filled out the submission for yesterday, and paid my entry fee. Apparently however, you need an installer. \*Oh\*. So today, after finishing the missing graphics, I got to do that. Huge thanks to [Seth](http://www.rtsoft.com) for sharing with me his [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net) script, which saved me hours of digging for little things like uninstaller cleanlyness, icon changing, and so many silly little things.

So, I have the game all ready and packaged up. Now, I&#8217;m seeing if I can cram in a map browser (something that should have been in years ago), so she&#8217;s all done and ready for the mass port freebie I&#8217;ll be doing soon. Yes, I&#8217;ll be releasing this update as freeware, with ports for MacOS X and an Allegro 4.2 Linux one. Maybe BeOS too just to get some use out of the copy I bought way back when.

Then, after some promo material and another round up, back to the new game.

1 day left. Oh boy.
