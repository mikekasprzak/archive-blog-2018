The [round up for October](http://www.gametunnel.com/html/section-viewarticle-138.html) is up, sporting the _sexah_ new look for the [Game Tunnel](http://www.gametunnel.com) website. This month sees Russell joining the ranks of the illustrious panel, bringing us to 4. It also shows us taking a more reserved 10 game count, which I think we&#8217;ll be sticking with moving forward.

So, how was the month? Two games I really liked this month, Weird Worlds and Cute Knight. Just as I said in my review, and as the others agreed, Weird Worlds is great. I&#8217;m not big on many games built around randomly generated maps, but it works excellent here. Then there&#8217;s Cute Knight. A kwirky little RPG&#8217;ish game I got a kick out of. There was also the unique strategy game Kosumi. I really tried to enjoy this game, but it would have been too much of a commitment. Still, I think it was a good month.
