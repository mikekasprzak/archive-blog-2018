Going through my Smiles HD TODO/Wishlist, one thing I&#8217;ve been meaning to add to the game for a long time was a minimize button. The game runs on several multitasking OS&#8217;s, but your only option up until now was to exit. Now, if the OS supports it, it can be suspended in to the background with just a click.

</div>While adding the minimize button, I looked to the Mac to get an idea what it should look like (actually, I was queuing up the latest Xcode when I noticed it). I borrowed Apple&#8217;s color scheme, but instead of a dash (-) I actually like the idea of an underscore (_) to mean minimize, as Windows does. So my iconic choices is a hybrid of Windows and Mac. Another thing, it seems Mac&#8217;s put the close and minimize buttons on the opposite side, so for the Mac version I&#8217;ve done this as well.

</div>It&#8217;s a minor thing, but something to consider when designing a user interface for multiple platforms: Where the users expect the buttons.
