On a mission to build corporate identity, the trials and tribulations of logo design. Given that introduction, &#8230; yeah, I was playing with logo design ideas. At the end of the day, I didn&#8217;t exactly come up with something to use. None the less, this is my blog, and I feel compelled to share it with myself, and any other misguided net travelers.

Here&#8217;s &#8220;_Ghastly logo_&#8220;. For my own amusement, you can see it&#8217;s evolution below.

Egads! Maybe as Halloween filler, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s suitable. It&#8217;s just a smidge too evil looking, don&#8217;t you think?  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

For reference, the old logo from last year. Also known as &#8220;_Swooshy hair logo_&#8220;.

I did like the idea of the swooshy hair originally. Now, I don&#8217;t like swooshy. So, the recent set of experiments are swooshless. I&#8217;m thinking either a face with some stunned look on it, or to be clever, changing it every game. Either way, more sketching and thinking ahead.
