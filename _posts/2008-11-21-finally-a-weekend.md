I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, &#8220;Smiles Drop&#8221;. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.

So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.

Wow&#8230; I think I can finally take a weekend off now.

I&#8217;m going to be pretty busy up until the end of the year, but it&#8217;s good busy. I suppose I&#8217;ll have some time to finally start diving in to some of the crazy stuff I did during the development of Smiles. I&#8217;ve got a handful of work in progress videos, and a few interesting bug videos. Or I could crack open Disgaea 3 and start playing finally.

Oh where to start? <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
