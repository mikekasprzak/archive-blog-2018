Wow!

Ludum Dare #14&#8217;s 123 entries in April was a pretty big deal, but our 15th Ludum Dare in August did a whopping **144**! Yikes!

On the plus side, [Phil](http://www.galcon.com) and I came together and awesome-ified the website. He wrote our _all new_ voting and submission system, and I made the site look new and _purty_. And when all was said and done, it actually worked! Wow!

It came together the weekend before the competition. I was finishing up my new [Smiles](http://www.smiles-game.com) trailer (see a few posts ago), [Phil](http://www.galcon.com) doing some Galcon stuff (probably&#8230; heh&#8230; I forget exactly), and one thing lead to another then blamo! An all new Ludum Dare.

Thursday was the game changer. We&#8217;d gone ahead and fixed the old submission system over the weekend, and got half talking about how we&#8217;d do a proper system. Then Phil was hit with some _maniacal_ inspiration. He wanted to take a stab at building the new compo system, and threw down some further demands for co-organizer [Mike](http://www.hamumu.com) and myself. So _not only_ did we get the submission system we&#8217;ve wanted for years now, but updates to our long out-of-date rules and FAQ, some additional stuff to improve the credibility of the website (logo page, an update to the about page), but **a freaking keynote** too!

The keynote was an idea I snuck on to our wishlist sometime around Ludum Dare 14. [Mike](http://www.hamumu.com) and I have been dabbling with video over the past year, and Mike had been producing [an entertaining video blog](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/08/28/welcome-to-ludum-dare-15/). So we put 2 and 2 together, and Mike headlined our opening ceremonies (we have those now?) with this great 3 minute keynote video of his.

So wow! And now we stand, the 48 hours have ended, and voting has now begun. In 2 weeks time, we&#8217;ll crown some winning games.

If that, along with Phil and my escapades at GDC in San Fransisco wasn&#8217;t enough, we got some fantastic news earlier in the week.

[Joseph White](http://www.lexaloffle.com), a long time Ludum Dare veteran got his latest game a slot in the **Sense of Wonder Night** at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show. Swarm Racer 3000, a great looking game based on his awesome Ludum Dare entry Swarm Racer. And of course with me in media mode, how could I not acknowledge him with a front page news post.

So wow. That&#8217;s Ludum Dare &#8216;eh? ðŸ˜€

So what&#8217;s next? At the very least, we&#8217;re gonna let the voting finish on this current compo. We&#8217;ll be holding the next big one, Ludum Dare 16, some time in December. We want to bring the rules a little more up to date, and do anything we can do to help foster this growth trend we&#8217;re seeing. We feel an odd sense of responsibility, now more than ever, to be sure it continues to grow. And well, there&#8217;s a pretty good chance (like 102%) you&#8217;ll be seeing me at GDC again. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll be representing, but hey I&#8217;ll be there, and hoping to see more Ludum Dare veterans showing their stuff in the IGF and beyond.

Anyways, back to your regularly scheduled &#8230; um&#8230; me ignoring my blog? Naw, I wanna start talking about stuff again. I&#8217;ll find a way. ðŸ™‚

PS: I edited this post, and [snuck it on to Gamasutra blogs](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MikeKasprzak/20090831/2894/Ludum_Dare_15_Was_Hugeer.php) Monday morning. Lo and behold, somebody awesome decided to give it the &#8220;featured&#8221; sticker, and it got to show up briefly on the front page of [Gamasutra.com](http://www.gamasutra.com). Cool!
