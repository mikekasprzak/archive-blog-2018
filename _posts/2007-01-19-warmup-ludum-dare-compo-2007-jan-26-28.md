Hey,

On the weekend of Jan 26-28 there will be an unofficial Ludum Dare warmup competition.
  
The compo will be held entirely in #ludumdare on irc.afternet.org. Final entries must be hosted on your own web space. Someone might put up a wiki, but that someone won&#8217;t be me  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

&#8211; Theme choice will be discussed and voted on Jan 26 at 7pm PST.
  
&#8211; Participants will have the whole weekend to create the game
  
&#8211; You must choose a single 24 hour time-slot to build your game (so, &#8220;all day Saturday&#8221;, etc, no taking all 72 hours to make the game. This is a mini-warmup compo with flexible hours.) Honor system and all that.
  
&#8211; Winners will be informally nominated after the competition. &#8220;I nominate so-and-so for best graphics!&#8221; 

Hope to see you there!

Stop by for some milk and cookies, and for some encouragement to get you out of any game making rut you may be in.
