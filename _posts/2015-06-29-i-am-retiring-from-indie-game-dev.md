It&#8217;s true. After 10 years, I&#8217;ll be wrapping up my games business. Later this year, I&#8217;ll be moving on to other things.

I am still going to be around. I&#8217;d still like to attend [**GDC**](http://www.gdconf.com) in San Francisco every year. [**Ludum Dare**](http://ludumdare.com) is a thing I&#8217;ll continue to work on and run (and if I&#8217;m lucky, I might be able to enter again some day). I&#8217;m also going to continue doing little projects that amuse me, things like [my Commodore 64 game](https://vine.co/v/OwxPlxgVTYn) from New Years. Really, not much is changing today. But it is time for me to move on from the Indie games business.

I&#8217;m going to try supporting myself with some non-game projects. I&#8217;ll talk more about what I&#8217;m doing in the coming months. As for the so called &#8220;Indie Games Business&#8221;, I just don&#8217;t trust it anymore, and that&#8217;s that.

Thanks everyone for all your support.
