Go Heart!' align='right' />So, that&#8217;s what happens on the 91&#8217;st day of the year shows up, your name is Mike, and you want to poke fun at casual gaming. You end up with a human body themed _match 3_, and an outrageous story that I don&#8217;t even want to rationalize. And yes, all Mike&#8217;s were thinking the exact same thing.

Yeah, this post is a rather plain one. Just a confirmation that yes, that was a joke, and an excuse to do an image dump. I especially like how the _action pose_ heart turned out. So much, I&#8217;ve been thrusting my arms in to the air all day. The funny looks from people are obviously looks of jealousy.

And here comes the team.

And together they form.

I couldn&#8217;t find a _Captain Planet_ picture I liked, and besides, _Jean Luc Picard_ is a way better Captain, and he totally destroys Captain Planet.

Over the course of the day, these &#8220;body parts&#8221; have also turned in to test objects for the game, as we&#8217;re short on interesting things&#8230; at least one&#8217;s we&#8217;re not embarrassed to show.

Oh, and I did receive a request for the art assets, which I shared, so there might actually be a playable game on the way. Pretty crazy for an April fools joke.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

Have a good one.
