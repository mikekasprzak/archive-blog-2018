The innovative games arms race is on.

&#8230; Alright, I give up.

Normally when I see a really fantastic game like this, I&#8217;m all excited (Spore). This one drove me in to a brief game design depression. Now that&#8217;s emergent gameplay at it&#8217;s finest, and I&#8217;ve not even played the game.

Concepts like collaborative editing and modern user friendly editing. Two ideas I&#8217;ve been extremely excited about toying with. &#8220;Oh, we do them both&#8221;. Bastards.

Sticking to objects. Cool. I toyed with something like that, and I called it The Spider. &#8220;Oh, but we can stick to things that move&#8221;. Oh yeah&#8230; holy sh$% that&#8217;s cool! &#8230;pause&#8230; Aww crap.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />

And it looks great, with depth of field effects and everything. Damn.

The innovative games arms race is on, and in full force.
