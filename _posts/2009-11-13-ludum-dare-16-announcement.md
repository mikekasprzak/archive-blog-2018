Ludum Dare is that _other thing_ I do. Along with [Phil](http://www.galcon.com), [Mike](http://www.hamumu.com) and [Seth](http://www.rtsoft.com), we run a community website based around the infamous Ludum Dare competition. Game developers from around the world assemble, pick a theme, and make a game from scratch over the weekend. Then we vote on our favorites.

Nowadays, we do it 3 times per year, this one being our regular December competition. In the off months, we also have members of the community choosing a theme for our mini monthly competitions. These mini competitions also gives us the opportunity to try out new things. Rule tweaks, and whatnot.
