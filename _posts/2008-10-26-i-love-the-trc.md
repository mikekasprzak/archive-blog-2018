Wow, it&#8217;s been so long.

The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.

By TRC I mean _Technical Requirements Checklist_. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines. Terms to use do identify aspects of the target platform, or the brand. Generally speaking, it&#8217;s everything you have to do to be officially allowed on a system.

The TRC process also includes requirements necessary for submission. How to package things up, naming conventions to use for files, and so on.

Apple&#8217;s TRC is interesting. It&#8217;s not as explicit as saying refer to the d-pad as the directional pad, but it&#8217;s more a collection of user interface and aesthetic design guidelines. After all, it&#8217;s a system without buttons*.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

Apple does have separate guides for name, logo, image, and trademark usage, as well as standard submission procedures. But it&#8217;s refreshing to be met with guidelines that encourage a streamlining of the user experience.

A perfect historic example, it&#8217;s a TRC requirement that every 3rd party title must display &#8220;Licensed by Nintendo&#8221; on the first screen you see. It&#8217;s the continued legacy of the so called [Nintendo Seal of Quality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Seal_of_Quality), as well as protecting them from liability. Even though you&#8217;re greeted with is the Nintendo logo on the original Gameboy, your relationship with Nintendo still must be made explicit.

Then that&#8217;s usually followed by half a dozen screens letting you know who paid for the game, what brands were licensed, and finally who made it before bringing up the title screen.

Not a problem per se, but Apple strongly encourages you to do away with this time wasting legacy. Like a &#8220;google.com&#8221; of a mobile interface. Right to the point.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; 

My point finally is the timing. TRC comes at the end of the project. It&#8217;s how you really tell the project is finally finishing. Making terminology corrections, digging through documents making sure you&#8217;re 100% to spec. Sure, it&#8217;s one more thing on a long list of things needed to finish a game. But what&#8217;s not to love about being done?

Early in my &#8220;career&#8221;, I always got the impression from friends and colleagues that the TRC was some sort of painfully horrible task, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve had my moments with them as well. But seeing how long it&#8217;s been from when I thought I was nearly done to now, I&#8217;ve been chasing TRC time for weeks and months. And it&#8217;s certainly a much better product as a result.

Potential sales, oh who knows. The weirdness seen watching the marketplace is topic all in itself. Might &#8216;break even&#8217;, might not. But I&#8217;m happy with the product. It&#8217;s everything I&#8217;d want in such a game.

Outside of some final testing, all I have left is the submission material. A text blurb for the store, some screen shots, an icon, and a large promotional graphic. That actually a piece of art I still need to create. I made sketches and roughs a few weeks ago, but never got around to coloring a final image. In this age of digital downloads, it&#8217;s the closest thing to box art.

A gameplay video isn&#8217;t an Apple requirement, but everybody does it anyways. You&#8217;ll have to give me a couple days for that. When that&#8217;s done, you&#8217;ll see it here first.

So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m up to. Testing, and promotional artwork.
