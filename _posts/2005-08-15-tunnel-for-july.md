July roundup action. Check it out [here](http://www.gametunnel.com/html/section-viewarticle-123.html).

Some fun stuff this time. Wild Tangent&#8217;s Fate, more or less Diablo 2 with a pet. Geneforge 3, an oldskool non Japanese RPG. Facade, the crazy &#8230; simulation of &#8230; people &#8230; with marage problems. Yeah, some really great stuff this month.

As for what&#8217;s going on, I originally ruled out the idea of actually getting something done for the IGF, but I&#8217;m starting to think I can pull something together. Due date is September 6th (so before then)&#8230; which sounds crazy, mind you, it&#8217;s a good thing August is a 31 day month.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />. Even if I don&#8217;t make it on time, if I can get ahead of myself by shooting for the date, all the better.

Welp, back to fun.
