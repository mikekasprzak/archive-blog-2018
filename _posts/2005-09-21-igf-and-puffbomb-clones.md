The [IGF 2006 Entries](http://www.igf.com/2006entrants.shtml) are now online, and we have a PuffBOMB clone to duel with. Impulse. It appers to be, according to the description, pretty much the same idea. Lets quote.

> **Impulse:** _The player must place bombs and adjust their timers to make a ball hit the goal field. Obstacles, special elements and force fields provide varied levels. An interactive timeline helps controlling the game by jumping to specific times and guarantees a flexible and unique gameplay._

Yup. At least it&#8217;s variation, using sport ideas (ball and goal) instead of characters.

Hehe&#8230; Really, I should be proud that people are doing stuff based on my old game. Alas, I&#8217;m still required to be dissapointed that I hadn&#8217;t done more sooner. Ahh well. Two and a half years and counting since it was released. So far, [two games](http://www.amazingworldgame.com/entertainment/details.php?id=3).

Anyways, time to get off my arse. The people will be finding the site soon. Maybe I should really get that revised prototype out ASAP.
