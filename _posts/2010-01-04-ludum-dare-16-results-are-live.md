I know it&#8217;s hard to compete with the wake of the IGF Finalists announcement yesterday, but the Ludum Dare 16 winners were announced yesterday too.

Go here for the Top 20:

And here for the news post:

Trying to compete with the IGF Buzz would be silly, so I&#8217;m going to push back my little LD retrospective until things are a little more calm. ðŸ˜‰

And [speaking of the IGF](http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html), special congratz to [Sparky](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/sparky/) and [Crackerblocks](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/crackerblocks/), whom are are both finalists this year.
