<img src="http://junk.sykhronics.com/pi/smiletastic.gif" align="right" />I&#8217;m actively preparing for &#8230; some event.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

On my to-do list for this miraculous day, is cleaning up the web sites. Well, I&#8217;ve finished 1 so far, the Sykhronics web site.

[www.sykhronics.com](http://www.sykhronics.com/)

It&#8217;s not functional, but I think it looks cooler/more professional than before. I&#8217;ll make it usable at some later date.

Since it&#8217;s a new month, here&#8217;s a couple notable images from last month. The first is are a little sketch I did for each of my grandmother&#8217;s in their Christmas cards.
