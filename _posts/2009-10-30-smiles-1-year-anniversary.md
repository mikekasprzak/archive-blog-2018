Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the launch of Smiles.

&#8230;

Yeah, it&#8217;s been that long already.

This weekend I&#8217;m giving **Smiles Zen** away for FREE. Also, I&#8217;ve discounting **Smiles** to $1.99 to reflect the price. I guess that&#8217;s how we celebrate 1 year on iPhone. ðŸ˜‰

In other news, Smiles 1.3 is on the way. I discovered a graphics performance bug on the newer iPhones and iPods (SGX), so that is now fixed. There were a few more little things too. Full release notes are as follows.

> Release Notes:
  
> &#8211; Improved SGX compatibility (iPhone 3GS, iPod touch 3rd generation)
  
> &#8211; Improved graphical performance
  
> &#8211; Improved touch sensitivity
  
> &#8211; Lower idle battery usage
  
> &#8211; Fixed &#8220;Total Games Played&#8221; statistic bug
  
> &#8211; Removed music instructions (obsolete)

Some friends of mine helped me realize that I do some pretty crazy research that I should be sharing on my blog. Especially the stuff I needed to make some of the bugfixes above. We&#8217;ll see.

Either way, I should really start doing more here. Bad Mike! You&#8217;re doing cool stuff, but keeping it all to yourself. ðŸ™‚
