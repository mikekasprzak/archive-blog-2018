<img src='/content/fear.gif' alt='Is he scared or staring at something?' align="right" />Slamdance was last week. PuffBOMB was a finalist for the PopCap award. A game by the name of Odyssey took the award. Congratz to them. The rest of the results can be found [here](http://www.slamdance.com/press/press_release.asp?article_id=524).

It&#8217;s a shame, but I couldn&#8217;t make it out this year. That, and I&#8217;m still getting things off the ground here at Syko. I had heard from my &#8220;contact&#8221; there would be some PuffBOMB action at the festival, but so far my search for evidence has come up short.

Anyways, photo collections of the event I&#8217;ve discovered thus far.
