February 29th! How could I _not_ say something today.

Just what to say is the question.

Blogging in the past, I&#8217;ve noticed the tendency to want to turn the blog _in to something_. A community, articles and subjects, talk-back, and all that stuff. And that&#8217;s great and all, but it&#8217;s a lot of work for not much return. Traditionally to make ends meet this way, you plaster your blog with advertisements, or actively soliciting contract work. No thanks.

Any readership I may have either hits me once a month, or watches me via RSS or an aggregator. And hey, that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m impressed that I have a readership  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />. A project shrouded in half-ass secrecy isn&#8217;t great content. Pulling away the curtain entirely isn&#8217;t easy to do, at least until the perpetual &#8220;later&#8221;. So instead, this blog collects occasional rants and the odd picture.

Exciting.

&#8230;

Not really.

I&#8217;m not ready to promise a change or anything, but I have a bit of a multi-part rant brewed. I&#8217;ve been putting a lot of serious thought and planning in to my next project, and in several ways it&#8217;s already started. I want it to be blogged right and from the beginning. That just happens to mean I start now.

So tomorrow, March 1st, I&#8217;ll be _at least_ posting part one. I&#8217;m not delay it for suspense or anything. The rant I&#8217;m staring at is long, technical, and self referential. The type of rant that&#8217;s really been holding me back from having more to talk about. For cohesions sake, I just want to sleep on it to be sure it all sounds right. It&#8217;s looking like it&#8217;ll be between 3 and 5 parts long.

Then, in theory, I can finally start talking in the present. Wow!

I want to start walking through my thought process of architecting &#8220;_the next_&#8220;. Where I&#8217;ve made mistakes, and so on. 

Heavy technical, just like mom used to make.
