I think it&#8217;s an important direction and discussion for game design. Sure, as a gamer, I can handle complicated control schemes. I&#8217;ve done my time and held my own in hotkey crazy RTS&#8217;s, twitch FPS&#8217;s, and I can be pretty menacing in Tony Hawk. But most of these games aren&#8217;t getting any easier. I don&#8217;t even care to finish Tony Hawk&#8217;s Project 8, or the Underground games, because the things you need to do at the end are ridiculous.

Some gamers like to mock Diablo because of it&#8217;s insanely simple control scheme, even your mom can play it (mine does). I&#8217;ve been in awe for a number of years by some of my _purist_ friends and associates who wouldn&#8217;t even justify it as an RPG for that very reason (reason 12 why genre&#8217;s hurt designers). Then it seemed the world forgot. Some 9 years later, [Fate](http://www.fatethegame.com) comes out. It plays just as well as it&#8217;s inspiration, and it&#8217;s more approachable. You can&#8217;t say that for any games in between.

It&#8217;s almost like the game industry _hard on_ for 3D graphics and difficulty is starting to calm it&#8217;s ass down.

Actually, what happened instead was the polar opposite distinctly emerged. Casual games. Short, easy games you can play for hours, if they so compel you. AKA: Match 3&#8217;s, stacking games, sorting games, and brick busters. Some of them [look really nice](http://cakemaniacs.blogspot.com/).

The Wii happened too. The _secret_ theoretical solution to FPS&#8217;s on the console, since we&#8217;re apparently too ignorant to support mouse and keyboard. I don&#8217;t know about other people, but for me the dust has certainly settled over the Wii. I still care for the platform for it&#8217;s ideals of smaller fun games, but the novelty of motion control has worn off on me. Red Steel isn&#8217;t an FPS, it&#8217;s a free moving Rail Shooter. That&#8217;s a heck of a lot more complicated to play than an FPS. Blast Factor for the PS3&#8217;s use of motion control is just a stupid gimmick at best. Call of Duty or Far Cry on the Wii I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to try yet, but I imagine the pointing box you need to restrict yourself to doesn&#8217;t make it any easier than Mouse+Keyboard.

So as I see it, the problem isn&#8217;t our joysticks, crappy motion sensors, mouse sensitivity, or lack of buttons. It&#8217;s that we&#8217;re not using them well enough. Many of the fondest memories of games many of us have are of game experiences full of simplifications. Pacman didn&#8217;t have to spin or strafe turning a corner; Megaman didn&#8217;t have to reload and find the rocket ammo to recharge his rockets; I didn&#8217;t have to hit forward, back rolling down to forward, back again for 2 seconds, then forward and punch while holding the R trigger to throw Ryu&#8217;s fireball; Or wait, there&#8217;s a parachute button? And Scorpion&#8217;s Fatality in MK1 was &#8220;block&#8221; and up twice. What other fatalities does anyone remember?

My mom, the typical hardcore casual gamer, should be able to pick up and play a perceptively intense action game, and she should be able to do some incredible things in it. There&#8217;s a way out there she can play a Gunstar Heroes. And there&#8217;s a reason out there why she&#8217;d play it too, and it ain&#8217;t pretty flowers and butterflies for graphics.

Why not?
