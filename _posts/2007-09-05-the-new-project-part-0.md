So it&#8217;s September now. Last time I gave a \*real\* update was a year and a half ago. A 7+1 part blog series titled &#8220;And the Project&#8221;, where I introduced what went in to a concept I called &#8220;The Spider&#8221;. You can read it here:

[Part 1](/2006/02/05/and-the-project-part-1/), [Part 2](/2006/02/05/and-the-project-part-2/), [Part 3](/2006/02/07/and-the-project-part-3/), [Part 4](/2006/02/07/and-the-project-part-4/)
  
[Part 5](/2006/02/07/and-the-project-part-5/), [Part 6](/2006/02/25/and-the-project-part-6/), [Part 7](/2006/02/26/and-the-project-part-7/), [Part &#8220;+1&#8243;](/2006/03/31/march-progress-grande/)

Well, nearly a year and a half later, as expected a lot has happened. My loyal reader might even remember the [job posting](/2007/01/30/2d-illustrator-or-animator-needed/) I posted a copy of in January. Stories you must have, yes?

I&#8217;m not ready to reveal everything today, especially not the latest stuffs. But after a year and a half, you accumulate quite a backlog. And I figure, there is much to take away from the process.

So, I&#8217;m taking a few steps back, and will starting talking about what&#8217;s been going on. My apologies, but I am starting with PuffBOMB lore, and working my way forward. After all, it&#8217;s _kinda_ important to what&#8217;s been going on.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

There you have it. Consider yourself teased.
