That’s right kids. It’s here. It’s begun. All that.

**Why are we here?**

Too Normal is my blog. Me, Mike, this questionably sane guy who makes games. Video games. That crazy amalgamation of visual and sonic goodness and a mighty tech chew. Too Normal is here to share my experience, observations and insight into what I do moving forward.

**Who are you?**

A “crazy” programmer with well over 5 years of commercial game programming experience, a dozen credits to my name, a history of programming and game development that goes back to when I measured my age with fingers, enough art skill that I get requests, a pair of credits doing voice acting (though I’m an awful actor), and several youthful years tracking music (this needs the most work). I also write for GameTunnel.

**When do we start?**

After all the years of crunching and giving up my time to game studios, I’m taking a break. In the next several weeks when my current project wraps up, I&#8217;m taking leave. That&#8217;s when the fun begins.

That&#8217;s it for now. This has been your introduction.
