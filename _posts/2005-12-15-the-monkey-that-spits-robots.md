<img src='/content/munkee.gif' alt='OMG! That\&#39;s one pink monkey!' align='right' />I&#8217;ve brought with me this horribly bright colored monster to burn your cornea. Hurah!

Right. Things are back and working in the Mike camp. Back to the grind and all. I&#8217;ve also recently finished a drawing pad, after slightly over 3 months. Doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but looking back it&#8217;s been taking me up to a year to fill one up.

So [IGF](http://www.igf.com) finalists have been announced. Funky. So many great games have been coming out later in the year, I&#8217;m not surprised [PuffBOMB](http://www.puffbomb.com) didn&#8217;t place. Maybe way back in 2003 when I made the game, and when the IGF wasn&#8217;t as cool of an event to be part of. Hey, I entered. It&#8217;s a start. Maybe next time.

All is not lost. Actually, it&#8217;s quite the opposite. I&#8217;ve received a rather encouraging note from the [SlamDance](http://www.slamdance.com/games/) camp. I imagine they&#8217;ll be posting a finalists list soon. Assuming I can trust my inbox, you should find PuffBOMB there on said finalist list. Not to mention, on display at the January SlamDance event. Very cool.

Oh, and before I forget, more cover-disks for the PuffBOMB freeware game. This months PC Zone (UK Mag) and Level (Czech Mag) cover-disks should feature the game. Very cool 2.

That should do for today. Lets see how much longer I can neglect to talk about what I&#8217;m working on. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
