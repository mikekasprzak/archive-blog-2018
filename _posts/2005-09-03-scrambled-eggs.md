A bit of a last minute scramble to get something together for the [IGF](http://www.igf.com). My original idea of getting the new game up and running, hahahaha&#8230; erm, sadly no. Progress is good, but not that good. However, I still am sending something. What I&#8217;m sending is the old PuffBOMB, from over 2 years ago, with a fresh paint job. The new look finally brings together my style ideas for the game from the past couple years It&#8217;s a chance to finally see it in action, and to know, does it suck or not.

This game isn&#8217;t finalist material. If I show up in California next year, I don&#8217;t deserve to be there. If that happens, I have too many friends. This, it&#8217;s only a message. Will we be heard?

Cryptic&#8217;s aside, after several years, I decided to dabble in some voice acting. I auditioned and landed a role in a Halo 2 based Machinima series. No, it&#8217;s not Red vs. Blue. I beat out 2, maybe 3 other kids and got the part I auditioned for. Not bad for a first try. In a mere hour, I recorded my 14 lines, which is actually all my dialog for the first 3 episodes. Heck, in the first episode I have 3 lines in total, the first 2 being a salute and a confirmation. What can I say, it&#8217;s practise. It was fun too.

An old kid like me get&#8217;s to learn how to act, and a young one gets to write and be a director. That&#8217;s pretty neat.

3 days left. A background and some touchups to go.
