First day of exhibiting. I have to say, I&#8217;m exhausted. Feet ached, and limped a bit throughout the day, but I loved it.

Here&#8217;s a few photos of the completed setup.

And a little closer.

I&#8217;m sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale. Me, I needed an &#8220;I&#8217;m not here&#8221; sign, so here&#8217;s what I came up with given the tools I had.

For the most part you didn&#8217;t see this, since I stuck around all day. Still, I was ready in case I had to step out. Left the sign and some cards when I finished for the night.

Dead tired, but I&#8217;ll be there again tomorrow. Hopefully, I can secure a chair for the day.
