Yep, it&#8217;s been in the pipeline since Saturday. [**Free Smiles**](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=303478061) is now available. It gives you both games to try (Zen and Drop).

**Zen** is the patience game. A unique game that&#8217;s like the combination of Solitaire and a Match 3. **Free Smiles** includes a single puzzle.

**Drop** is both a relaxing and action puzzler. It&#8217;s unique combination of timerless play, with various optional easy twitch gaming features like making multiple matches while other clear, twisting the iPhone, and floaters.

**Free Smiles** includes a special challenge mode of **Drop**. The game ends after 200 matches, except for combo&#8217;s. You can keep a combo going as long as you can, but as soon as it ends, the game ends. My best during testing was about 360 matches. Give it a try.
