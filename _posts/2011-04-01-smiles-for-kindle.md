Happy April 1st!

To start, my thing to make you laugh.

I&#8217;ll be finishing this up in the coming weeks. I had to prioritize some stuff ahead of it due at the end March (another reason I&#8217;ve been so quiet post GDC). There was also a faux pas on my part, but nothing too big&#8230; I just have to drive down to the US border and activate a 2nd gen Kindle. Totally fine! Next week!

I&#8217;ll have more soon. No joke!

The final stretch of Smiles ports is upon us! 

**Symbian^3** has been submitted to Nokia, Smiles for **Maemo** (N900) is already available (and selling pretty good). 

**Android** is finished and working great, I&#8217;m just waiting on a bugfix in the middleware I used ([Airplay SDK](http://www.airplaysdk.com)). To other developers, I strongly recommend checking out Airplay. The team at Ideaworks have done a fantastic job (you can even do iPhone dev on Windows). 

Soon! I&#8217;m so very close to being finished this herculean task of &#8230; well, whatever you want to call my port-crazyness.

Ludum Dare #20 is coming up April 29th, and ToJam #6 in the middle of May. The former I run, and the later I&#8217;ve been invited out to. Assuming I&#8217;m not in New York for a certain \*something something\*, expect me in Toronto for the To&#8217;s and the Jam&#8217;s.

That&#8217;s all for now. Home stretch!
