So finally, Smiles 1.1 for Netbooks (The Intel AppUp Center) has been submitted. Also, though Moblin Netbook Smiles was submitted last week, it came back with a very minor issue. That is now fixed, and sent as well. So Netbook Smiles == all done.

I have 1 last mobile port I&#8217;m doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each. I&#8217;m hoping to be finished with the Bada port in a few days, but we&#8217;ll see. The OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering branch is prepped and totally ready for Sammy.

Then, at last, the **Mystery Platform** port.

**Mystery Platform** requires numerous changes and additions to meet my needs, and the needs of the platform holder. It&#8217;s certainly the most work of all the ports. But the platform is totally awesome, hence all the emphasis as a _mystery_. I&#8217;m very excited about it. ðŸ™‚

My plan initially was to try crunching it together in a month (June), but I think I&#8217;m going to take it easy, and also start on the ground-work for the new projects (i.e. adding library features, cleaning up my UI code, fixing my broken 3D code, making some tools?, etc). I will be using Smiles and the **Mystery Platform** port as a test-bed and reference for the refactoring I&#8217;m doing, but I expect myself to jump back and forth between non-Smiles tests in the process. By the end of the summer, I want Smiles for **Mystery Platform** done and out, and to be totally ready to seriously start the next project.

Anyways, it&#8217;s time to go erase 2 more items off my whiteboard. ðŸ™‚
