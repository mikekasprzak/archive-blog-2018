Yes, spreading is what we&#8217;re doing. Since I&#8217;m a nice guy, and since it&#8217;s probably a bad idea to wait, I&#8217;ve released the supped up classic 2003 PuffBOMB Prototype to the public. A download link can be found at the &#8216;official&#8217; PuffBOMB homepage, [PuffBOMB.com](http://www.puffbomb.com).

Currently it&#8217;s only available for Windows. Hopefully, I can have the MacOS X version ready to go soon.

Mmm&#8230; robots and vegitation.
