The title says it all. Finally, after 10 months in the App Store, I&#8217;ve decided to try out the infamous 99 cent iPhone price with Smiles.

I sent an early pre-release note to some of the iPhone press, as well as my twitter. So far it&#8217;s been picked up by [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2009/08/27/99-cent-sales/) which is always a good place to start.

I&#8217;m hopeful. The new trailer is out there in the wild now, and-a&#8230; now we wait. ðŸ™‚

PS: An amusing shot from some experiments.
