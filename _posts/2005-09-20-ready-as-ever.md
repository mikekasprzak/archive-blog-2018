<img src='/content/scotchcrotch.gif' alt='Wahtah' align="right" />Hurah! Finally open. Welcome. Come on in and hear me think.

At some point throughout the day I was working. Really, I was; You can trust me. My new (3rd) office whiteboard just arrived this morning. I took the liberty of violating it with some math/physics filth. It seems to be holding up well, which is good, as I expect many more shamefull acts of mathematics to be performed on it.

What&#8217;s been going on? Geez, there was a whole 5 day gap there, and I never did really talk much before the IGF deadline was looming.

Art, yeah, I&#8217;ve been doing lots of drawing. I recently moved on to a new sketchbook. I&#8217;m 5 pages in so far, but I like filling up the whitespace, so that&#8217;s 30-60 some odd doodles per page. I&#8217;ve started doing art study&#8217;s, thanks to a recommendation I saw in a tutorial. A few weeks ago I did one I&#8217;ll call &#8220;small arms on small bodies&#8221;. More or less, just taking some rectangular shapes, and adding little rectangular arms in various poses and expressions. More recently, I decided to dive in to something more complex, and identify some style elements of [the Creatures in my Head](http://www.creaturesinmyhead.com/). I tend to do more minimal designs, but I still dig Andrew&#8217;s work.

Code, Ok&#8230; After hacking up the &#8220;remixed&#8221; PuffBOMB prototype for the IGF a few weeks back, and spending some time on an outstanding commitment, I&#8217;m back on the goods. Between now and then, I wanted to take a short mental break, and I did. I knocked a few things off my list today, like an annoying bug in my build system. On a related note, the new [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) is great. With it&#8217;s built in spell check and auto completion of class names, file names and changes, it rules. I like it so much, I just added a documents repository for my GameTunnel round up reviews and other written projects I care to attempt.

Audio, I&#8217;ve been fiddling with [ReNoise](http://www.renoise.com) some more. Silly me, I finally figured out how to use the [E-MU Emulator X](http://www.emu.com/products/product.asp?category=501&subcategory=168&product=9866) software correctly in ReNoise, without needing an instance of the VST per sample. I&#8217;ve also been contemplating picking up [MadTracker](http://www.madtracker.org), as I need something that can do a normal tracked format (XM, even though I was always an IT/S3M guy). Not that any of this is meaningful, I&#8217;m just saying what&#8217;s on my mind.

And&#8230; well&#8230; that should do for now. Have a nice day.
