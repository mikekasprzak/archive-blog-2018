Yep. [It&#8217;s coming](http://ludumdare.com:8081/forum_read_comments.html?forum=2&comment=1414). Beyond suggesting the date, I&#8217;ve been too busy to get really involved, but it&#8217;s coming. This might be one of the most last minute LD&#8217;s in a couple years, but it should come together.

After all, it&#8217;s an April tradition.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

Visit us on irc.afternet.org in #ludumdare, and start some fires, and help us get things moving.

The mailing list is still there, though the website is down. I&#8217;m in the middle of splitting my websites between personal and business on to 2 separate hosts, [gamecompo.com](http://www.gamecompo.com) being a personal one.
