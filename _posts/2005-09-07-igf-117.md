Oh wow, the IGF is getting serious now. A news report on [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6445) suggested that the [IGF](http://www.igf.com) hit a record entry high of 117&#8230; Which is&#8230; many.

Like the dork I am, I&#8217;ll be monitoring this stuff. Don&#8217;t think this&#8217;ll be the last of my IGF rantings, oh no! Mwahaha!

Oh, and I&#8217;ve aparently become a big fan of incorrectly linking the IGF. Instead, I&#8217;ve found myself linking an equally prestigious organization, The Royal Society for the Relief of Indigent Gentlewomen of Scotland ([Fund](http://www.igf.org/)). Isn&#8217;t that just &#8230; smashing.
