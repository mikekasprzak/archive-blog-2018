Been working on the HTML5 side of my library code, and I kinda made this little demo for fun. Music is [Garth Knight&#8217;s](http://garth-knight.bandcamp.com/music) track [Activate the Cage](https://soundcloud.com/garth_knight/garth-knight-activate-the-cage).

Ludum Dare 30 is this weekend. Hoo boy! Running that crazyfest is keeping me sooo busy. ðŸ™‚
