I kept video of some of my more interesting bugs/glitches/oddities in **Smiles**. Some more silly than others.

The first I want to show is a bug in one of the effects for the game mode **Zen**. It was supposed to be a &#8220;toss a rock in to a pond&#8221; water ripple. It didn&#8217;t really work as expected.

Here&#8217;s what it was supposed to look like. Cool looking, but the problem with this was the effect would make you queasy.

In the end I had to tone this down. It&#8217;s still in the game, but very subtle now. Not a good idea to make your customers get sick.

The next bug is a little more minor. I was building my menu screens, and gave some elements the same ID as one of my buttons.

The last one is just me being silly. Working on the achievement unlocked effect, I decided the achievements should have a conversation with themselves.

And that&#8217;s my list of interesting things that happened during **Smiles**&#8216; development.
