The compo is going ahead full force, despite our complete lack of publicity and organization.

The theme is &#8220;**Build the Level You Play**&#8220;. In other words, design a game leveraging user creation or user created content, or a game of building. Line Rider, PuffBOMB, The Incredible Machine, and much more. We&#8217;ve seen some pretty exciting ideas discussed in IRC, so don&#8217;t miss out.

Stay tuned for Ludum Dare 10. It&#8217;s such a grand number, we can&#8217;t help but not go all out on it. Revised rules too! After 5 years! zOMG!
