Alright, we&#8217;ve got a nice backlog of posts to make this blog look meaningful now. I&#8217;ll quickly spruce up the logo, and sneak off to some magical forums claiming &#8220;Oh! Didn&#8217;t I tell you, I have a blog too! I can&#8217;t believe it never came up in conversation. Har Har Har&#8221;. Yes, it will be brilliant.

A new round up should be on the Tunnel soon. Russell was down in TV land promoting the site on Attack of the Show. Spreading the word, keeping it&#8230; err&#8230; indie.

More to say soon.
