Page 50. Two and a half months later.

Sure it&#8217;s not front page news (except maybe for here), but it&#8217;s a small achievement I like to indulge myself in. Being a coder, I code a lot. Or at least, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing professionally these past 6 years. So, I&#8217;m on a mission to improve my art and music skillzorz whilst on my adventures in independent game development. This little burning through a sketchbook challenge has been a constructive one for me. Previously, it&#8217;s been taking me 8 months to a year to go through a mere 50 pager. I&#8217;d like to be pushing it down to a month per, but I&#8217;m sitting at a 3 and a half, and my recent 2 and a half.

So, for fun, a small selection of confusing imagery not previously displayed.

And scary things from the future&#8230; err&#8230; I mean the new sketchbook.
