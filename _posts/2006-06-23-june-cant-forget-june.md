<img align="right" alt="It\" src="/content/macpb.gif" />Well, I&#8217;m not going to let the month go by without posting something. After all, I have been doing much stuff. Not so much round up, but many many other things.

The project progresses. We&#8217;re busy preparing a pitch-able playable of the game that we&#8217;ll be pitchely pitching to potential pitch-able people pretty pitching soon. I&#8217;ll have less riddles and more to say about that in a few weeks.

Also, I&#8217;ve silently (and finally) put together a [MacOS X version of PuffBOMB](http://www.puffbomb.com). Sadly, it&#8217;s only for Power PC based Mac&#8217;s running Panther (10.3) or better. I don&#8217;t have an Intel Mac, so I don&#8217;t know if it runs under Rosetta. I&#8217;ve also done some minor bug fixing with the Windows version (Dual Core friendly now), and made a slight improvement to the background (subtle teaser to your right, can you tell the difference?). This was inspired by and for something I&#8217;ll talk about soon (NDA).

As for other fun things, I&#8217;ve been toying with videos! I recorded gameplay demonstration movies of the infamous PuffBOMB, and one of a other lesser known prototype game of mine, Zooble.

I&#8217;ll probably encode more historic game videos later. I do have a couple prototype progress videos of the current stuff, but I&#8217;m sitting on those until we sign something.

And now I&#8217;m off to see if I can safely upgrade and &#8220;fix&#8221; my spam problem here. I temporarily disable commenting,that way I wouldn&#8217;t have wake up every morning and delete Viagra, Home Insurance/Mortgages, Casinos, Poker, and whatever other crap I&#8217;ve been manually filtering. Manual sucks.
