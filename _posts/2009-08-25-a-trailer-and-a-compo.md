Yes yes, I&#8217;m awfully quiet. What else is new?

Let me tell you.

First things first, a brand new trailer for Smiles.



Why does Smiles need a new trailer? I&#8217;ll tell you when you&#8217;re older.

This ended up taking a couple weeks longer than I&#8217;d hoped it would (spontaneous summer vacation?), but it&#8217;s done. The new trailer combines the tidbits dropped in the last post (mushroom animation, new logo), some gameplay footage, and a nice audio track. I rather like the results.

Related, I made some minor tweaks+updates to the Smiles website. Not much to brag about, but it seems it was rather out of date.

Not anymore! ðŸ™‚

Next up, Ludum Dare 15 is this weekend.

I somehow found (made?) time to do a bunch of website work, including refreshing the logo as seen above. The compo site has a brand new look too, so go check it out. Eventually I&#8217;ll bring this fancy new look to the rest of the site&#8230; just probably not this week. ðŸ˜‰

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

There&#8217;s probably something I&#8217;m missing, but I&#8217;m busy trying to make some big news right now.

Ta ta!
