So basically, this entire series of tool research posts is the result of me searching for an Oscilloscope, and then discovering my existing workflow was bad. 

I&#8217;ve lost count at how many hours I&#8217;ve spent doing homework on low cost high value scopes. I&#8217;ve explored a variety of offerings from Siglent, Rigol, Owon, Uni-T, Hantek, and others, trying to find the best value. I don&#8217;t have the desk space for an old analog scope (which is a way to get a good scope for under $100). So I need a smaller digital scope to fit my setup.

I&#8217;ve tried to give each brand a fair shake, but in the end, all signs point to one.

## Rigol DS1054Z

Cost: **$399 US**

**Pros**
  
&#8211; 4 Channels (Bonus!)
  
&#8211; 50 MHz (software upgradable to 100 MHz)
  
&#8211; Integrated Help
  
&#8211; Pretty much everything you want
  
&#8211; Small
  
&#8211; Low price (given what it can do)

**Cons**
  
&#8211; One set of knobs shared amongst each channel (versus separate knobs per channel)
  
&#8211; Fan could be quieter
  
&#8211; Not-so-great FFT (no substitute for a spectrum analyser)
  
&#8211; Many built-in features cost extra *

I&#8217;ve mentioned EEVblog several times, a very picky experienced EE, and this is his recommended scope.

After much fuss, too much reading, I can&#8217;t seem to find a scope in this price range that does everything as well as this one, and that even ignores the fact that it has 4 channels. You get 4 channels! Everything else in the price range has 2. Madness!

## Summary

I&#8217;ve accepted there&#8217;s no other scope that even comes close. The only reason I haven&#8217;t purchased it, is that buying one will cost me about **$650 CAD**&#8230; which is a lot of money. Every non-oscilloscope device I&#8217;ve been researching costs under (or around) $100. $650 is a lot.

I&#8217;ve actually found cheaper scopes. Amazon.ca has a few Siglent scopes for just over $400 CAD, no tax (roughly $300 USD). I got real close to buying one, but ultimately stopped myself once I realized it wasn&#8217;t the latest Siglent model (those cost about $800 base). Then I learned about some of scopes that, for whatever reason, can be hacked to become better scopes.

Actually, I do have an Oscilloscope. A really basic one I picked up in 2009 called the DSO Nano.

I&#8217;ve never really used it seriously, but it&#8217;s not exactly the most useful oscilloscope. You can buy a DIY kit for about $20 that does basically the same thing.

So yeah, scopes. I know what I want, but now comes convincing myself to spend the money.
