October is a very special month at Ludum Dare. Here&#8217;s a post I just did on Gamasutra blogs.

> Hey! I&#8217;m Mike, an [Independent Game Developer](http://www.sykhronics.com) up in Canada, and one of the main people behind the [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) Online Game Jam event. I&#8217;m here to invite you to participate in a very special event we&#8217;re running this month, **The October Challenge**.
> 
> The Challenge isn&#8217;t your typical game jam, but the rules are simple:
> 
> <p style="text-align: center;">
>   <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Finish a game &mdash; Take it to market &mdash; Earn $1</strong></span>
> </p>
> 
> Take something you made during a prior game jam, something else you&#8217;ve been working on, or even make something entirely new over the month. Before November 1st, publish or submit your game to your respected market. And if it earns $1, you did it! Easy as that.
> 
> More details can be found on our website.

> <http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/09/28/announcing-october-challenge-2011/>
> 
> As with typical Ludum Dare events, your game and your successes are yours. Our aim here is to encourage a large group of game developers to finally make-good on that goal of making and selling a game, or those already doing it to push harder and finish something new.
> 
> We&#8217;re also inviting platform holders, distribution systems, portals, or anyone involved in funding or getting games in front of people to step up. We have an eager community of content creators looking for opportunities to make money from the games they create.
> 
> Details, and the current list of opportunities can be found here:

> 
> Participants are encouraged to share progress with us on the [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) website. We&#8217;ll be setting up a submission form soon to collect a list of all games finished for the Challenge.
> 
> That&#8217;s the challenge. Do you accept?

Phew! Okay, back to game stuff.
