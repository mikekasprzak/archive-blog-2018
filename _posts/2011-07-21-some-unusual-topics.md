Here&#8217;s a couple videos from [the series](http://youtube.com/user/indieconversation), some of the more odd things I&#8217;ve posted.

The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone&#8230; here&#8217;s what I see:

Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad.

It&#8217;s a neat device. You can get more details about coding for it [here](http://struct.ca/2011/icademanager/).

This catches up my queue. I have some videos about some of my thought process on the new game, but I&#8217;ll bring those up at a later time once I have more to say.
