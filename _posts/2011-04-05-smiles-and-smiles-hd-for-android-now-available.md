To say the Android port has was the most requested would be an understatement. I sent messages to the list of starred people in my e-mailbox, everyone that ever asked about the Android version&#8230; I hope I got everyone. It feels good to finally have this covered. Ahhh!

There are 2 versions of the game available. Content wise they&#8217;re totally the same, but the difference is as follows:

**Smiles** &#8211; Phone version &#8211; 23 MB
  
**Smiles HD** &#8211; Tablet version &#8211; 37 MB

Technically speaking, Smiles HD includes artwork that is 4x the size (double width, double height), and music at 2x the bitrate. I&#8217;ve made some minor tweaks to the store text so to make the difference between each more obvious.

What&#8217;s interesting though is that the HD version seems to work on my phones, but it is slower. The Nexus One especially, it runs, but the load time is much worse; The part I really don&#8217;t like is that every time the game needs to load a new art asset, it briefly freezes. This looks pretty crappy, so my recommendation is that depending on the device you own (phone or tablet), you should get the version mentioned above.

Of note, the Nexus S is a top-of-the-line beefy phone, and has no troubles running the HD version (it just loads slower). Your mileage may vary, and you&#8217;re welcome to save a couple bucks by buying just one version. I&#8217;m hoping this &#8220;feature&#8221; doesn&#8217;t a support headache for me. ðŸ˜‰

That&#8217;s all for now. Heck, that&#8217;s big news. I don&#8217;t need anymore! ðŸ˜€
