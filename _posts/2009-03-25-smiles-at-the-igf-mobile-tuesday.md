Live from San Fransisco, it&#8217;s&#8230; me.

As you may or may not have heard, I didn&#8217;t win. But that&#8217;s alright, I&#8217;m still here to exhibit.

We&#8217;re sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they&#8217;ll find us too. Here&#8217;s my slice.

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/smilesigfbooth-337x450.jpg" alt="smilesigfbooth" title="smilesigfbooth" width="337" height="450" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-903" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/smilesigfbooth-337x450.jpg 337w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/03/smilesigfbooth.jpg 684w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/smilesigfbooth.jpg)

Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome. The part I love though, Smiles is the 1st game listed on the page. I&#8217;ll have to take some shots of iTunes when I get home.

Also, it seems I finally hit a chart. Smiles, for the first time, was on the Strategy Game Top 100 in the App Store. It wasn&#8217;t that high, but I saw it. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what a day of &#8220;on a chart&#8221; sales looks like.

That is it for today. I&#8217;ll be sure to snap a photo of it properly set up. I don&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;ll change much on Thursday/Friday, but if I can think of anything related to snap, I&#8217;ll be sure to do it. Until tomorrow.
