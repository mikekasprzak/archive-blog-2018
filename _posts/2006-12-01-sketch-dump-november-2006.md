Had a harder time this month scrounging up content unrelated to PuffBOMB I liked.

To be an ass, and to make everybody (else) behind the scenes happy, I&#8217;m sitting on this stuff until we&#8217;ve pitch it (Mid January is our target). Lots of tweaking and tuning, especially in the art style area. Getting a background look I&#8217;m happy with has turned out to be more troublesome than I&#8217;d hoped. None the less, the battle rages on.

So until I&#8217;m ready to share more game visuals, some &#8220;other&#8221; stuff from the digital sketchbook.
