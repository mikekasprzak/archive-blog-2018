This next engines name and story is a little complicated.

Game development became a constant burn out for me. Since finishing **Secret Agent Barbie** (Gameboy Advance) and **Polly Pocket** (Gameboy Advance), it became clear to me the only thing keeping me going was my fascination with new platforms. Certainly not the subject matter.

After we finished **Polly Pocket**, I asked for a month off to deal with my burn out. However, we quickly picked up a new game, **Barbie: Gotta Have Games** (Playstation). The game was incredibly late in the Playstation lifetime, but Barbie&#8217;s a hard brand to make fail. This was my last chance to do a Playstation 1 game, with the PS2 nearly 3 years old at the time. I had to take it.

After that was finally done, I took my month off. I wouldn&#8217;t say I was recovered, but I was in heck of a lot better shape than I was before I left. That lead to **Brown Box**, leaving DICE, joining my friends company to &#8220;play&#8221; management, and eventually to **Destructure**.

As **Atomic Betty** was going to be my last project at Big Blue, **Destructure** was retired as the **Atomic Betty** engine. Whenever I start an engine project, I always intend on making something reusable. But as usual, I end up with too many things I want to do differently the next time.

So a burned out programmer, all of his last 5 notable projects girl games, anxiously anticipating his chance to finally do the games he wants to. What sort of iconic name has he brewed for his engine?

He calls it **Freedom**.

Now, I don&#8217;t want to give the wrong impression. Big Blue was and still is the best company I&#8217;ve worked for, and I&#8217;d gladly work with them again. The engine name is about philosophical freedom. I like to joke with friends about my _girl game curse_. In actuality, I&#8217;m just not happy working in the traditional business model of developing licensed games. Of course it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ll do a project again to replenish my reserves, but I can still go a while longer.

Outside of my early retirement, the **Freedom** engine was motivated by the console downloadable game revolution. It didn&#8217;t exist yet, but we all _knew_ it was coming (fingers crossed). I was officially &#8220;retired&#8221; in August 2005, and that&#8217;s when my focus became **Freedom**.

With the 360 only a few months away, I was going to be ready!!

&#8230;

Oh&#8230; that&#8217;s right! It seems I&#8217;d forgotten about the burn out.

Truthfully, I don&#8217;t think I was ready for anything until at least a year later. That didn&#8217;t stop me from chaotically developing whatever seemed cool at the time.

Going back again, **Destructure** was inspired by the potential of downloadable games of the time. This was mid 2004, where this was Casual games. Back then, I was an Indiegamer regular. I watched and discussed business theory with many who have gone on to become major players in casual games. I&#8217;d even gotten myself involved in GameTunnel, to do extra research. At Big Blue, we&#8217;d regularly geekishly discuss the casual and mobile games market, as we worked our asses off to recreate the glory days of DICE&#8217;s &#8220;Team Gameboy&#8221;. We came close enough, girl game and all.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

But with projects like Gastronaut&#8217;s Fuzzee Fever on the original XBLA, and The Behemoth&#8217;s Alien Hominid, the juices of inspiration and potential were not only flowing, but boiling and bubbling. Where **Destructure** started with the goal of breaking in to PC casual games, **Freedom** was nextgen.

**Freedom** was designed to be an HD ready 2D game engine. As a result, one of the earliest purchases I made was one of those lovely 24&#8243; Dell&#8217;s. Slightly higher resolution than a 1080p HDTV, and \*much\* cheaper. As before, the **PuffBOMB** remake was on the agenda, but structure doesn&#8217;t come easy to a burn out.

So the **Freedom** engine was built, and it became a testbed for physics ideas. Eventually I&#8217;d start toying with Gish like squishy blobs, and ropes. This lead to **The Spider**, a double rope platformer experiment, again, spearheaded by the sound mind of a freshly &#8220;retired&#8221; burned out coder.

I&#8217;ve already talked about The Spider a bunch already (with videos) in my previous attempts to get up to date. Check these out if you want to know more.

During **The Spider** was also when I recruited my brother to help out. This was near the end of 2005. His main task was editor programming while I built the engine. We&#8217;d share the content building duties.

He&#8217;d previously worked on some contract mobile games, as well as helping out on my earlier efforts. Of note, he did most of the map and world building on **Murmur&#8217;s Dungeon** (the 6-1997 game above), and helped a bunch with the character design on **Islandgates** (the 10-1997 game, lots of content we never got around to using).

As expected, bringing on somebody new (especially someone as familiar and opinionated as a sibling) encouraged a bit of an identity crisis for **The Spider** project. Despite, as I&#8217;ve suggested before, the game wasn&#8217;t well developed either. Adding him probably helped more than hurt.

During development of **The Spider**, it became clear that the goals of the project weren&#8217;t clear. More ambitious than anything. With tools, a working engine in hand, and some outside &#8220;encouragement&#8221;, we started discussing games of smaller scope we could pull off.

**The Spider** was followed by the destructible scenery project, **Ballistic Force**.
