Amazing. Today was my official last day at Big Blue Bubble. BBB was a great place to work, but I&#8217;m a too ambitious for my own good. So, lets see if I can make this happen.

The next couple weeks are some down time. Taking things easy, doing some organization, making backups, and so on. Being realistic, I&#8217;ve missed my chance to make the IGF. On the other hand, there&#8217;s still something this year I can shoot for. Should be fun.

A new look here too. It&#8217;s a borrowed theme with some minor changes, until I have the interest in building a custom one.
