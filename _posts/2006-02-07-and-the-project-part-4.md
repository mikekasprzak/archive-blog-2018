So we have a character, and certain way the physics work. Cool. I want this game out reasonably soon, so that meant I needed to keep things simple. So minimal amounts of non functional stuff and no heavy animation. I don&#8217;t have an art team, just me. So the thought was to make the legs dangle and have shots of webbing shoot out.

And sure, this&#8217;ll make some nice still shots, but the character was going to be very nonfunctional looking. It just sort of floats there, and things shoot out of him. Actually, that&#8217;s kind of weird. Hmm, trying to rationalize this brings up some odd imagery.

The rope shooting core mechanic works well. To make a spider really work, I&#8217;d have had to use his legs more. Looking back, I&#8217;d imagine constructing webs through a level for use by your character, vaguely similar to rainbow platforms in [Rainbow Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Islands). But again, this&#8217;d be an abstract control, which like PuffBOMB would work best on a mouse. Nope, the scheme here is direct and local to the character. An analog gamepad works well here, which is a goal behind the project.

The solution to my &#8220;practical lazyness&#8221; seemed to be to de-evolve the character. The design isn&#8217;t finalized, but it&#8217;s certainly brought up some questions, and provided solutions to functionality problems. Not to mention, opened up several more control possibilities. We&#8217;re almost up to date. Don&#8217;t miss our exciting next episode. Part 5, _The Character_.
