<img src='/content/pb_igf_done.gif' alt='Yes, it\&#39;s all done' align="right" />Hmm, it seems I misplaced this blog post.

With less than 5 hours to spare, it&#8217;s in. Excellent. It wasn&#8217;t without it&#8217;s drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. \*OH GOOD\*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!

Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it&#8217;s folder, hit the switch, and waited as it&#8217;s bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area. Fun.

So there it is. I&#8217;ll be sitting on this revamped version of the game for a few weeks, as I get some promotional material together (i.e. screen shots) of the new game. Then, when I can clearly distinguish that it&#8217;s a different product we&#8217;re pushing (not the old PB), it&#8217;ll go out as a freebie. And hey, the Mac guys will finally be able to play. A shame though, that they can&#8217;t use the old map editor.

Time to celebrate with,&#8230; Sleep! Something I&#8217;m far to familiar with as of late. Ahh, time off is great. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />
