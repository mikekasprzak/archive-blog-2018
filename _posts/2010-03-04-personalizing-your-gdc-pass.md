Ordinarily, greeting someone by glancing at their chest might be seen as a little rude (especially a lady), but at GDC it&#8217;s encouraged! Yes I&#8217;m talking about _the passes_, not making a pass.

The passes do a good job of helping you connect a face to a name, and even a company, but you don&#8217;t always know who made or represents what. GDC passes include a relatively large pocket, so you could either make something to insert behind your name card, or cover the pass with some strategically placed stickers.

My stickers I made are 2.2 inches by 0.7 inches each, then printed on inkjet sticker paper. At that size you can fit 2 above the Game Developers Conference label (assuming they&#8217;re the same as last years), and a 3rd in the gap between the clips. If you need more space, you can always cover the logo; And if you are, you may as well make 1 big sticker to save the cutting effort.

**Pro Tip**: Put spare business cards behind everything in your GDC pass pocket. That way they&#8217;re easy to reach and give to people.
