An intense month of work awaits. Crunch time, and then some!

Early/Mid last week, I spec&#8217;d out _the plan_ for my time between now and GDC. Quite a busy schedule, with a lot of really cool things coming up. Smiles stuff, and a quick collaboration with a friend, which I&#8217;ll talk more about later. I should have plenty to talk about with my internet colleagues in March.

But the icing on the cake was a _development_ Wednesday/Thursday of last week. I&#8217;m going to be a little vague right now, but what I will say is I am porting Smiles to a new phone, and have been for the past week. Between this and that, I have a whole bunch of little things going on too. My brother&#8217;s wedding tomorrow, a little Apple event I&#8217;m attending next week in Toronto, getting Ludum Dare 16 started on time, and deadlines galore. So wow.

But what this post is about is a little ritual of mine. Fridge stocking.

Now, I do normally have a nice variety of drinks in my fridge, caffeinated and whatnot. But it&#8217;s only special occasions where I go the extra mile and pack it this full. Not seen is the bottom left crisper filled with Jones Cola, and a couple packs of Monster.

The freezer is replenished with a fresh stock of frozen dinners, cereal in the cupboard, and last but not least, noodles!

Numerous varieties of quick junk meals and drinks. And I can guarantee you, there **will** be pizza. ðŸ˜€

Oh yes!

So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on with me right now. Powering through code, caffeinated drinks, and ramen noodles.

I&#8217;d hope to talk a little more about the design process as it happened, and I may still do that. But I know for the next couple weeks it&#8217;ll be nose to the grindstone.

See you soon.
