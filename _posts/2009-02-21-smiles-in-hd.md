Rebuilt the texture atlas&#8217; for the weather and vegetables tilesets, and resized the majority of the in game assets. 3x&#8217;d the iPhone res instead of 4x&#8217;d, as that would be far too huge.

Art is large enough for 1080p, but the game needs numerous changes to properly support the new aspect ratio(s).

Ahem&#8230; not to mention the numerous art fixes I&#8217;ll have to make now that you can see all the detail&#8230; heh.
