Summary.

    I'm documenting with a video how I upgraded device firmware using a PIC programmer (generic Chinese PICKit 2). <a href="https://t.co/bYD1ZnFOny">pic.twitter.com/bYD1ZnFOny</a>

The PICkit connector is 6 pins, but the last pin is the Auxiliary pin.

This pin doesn&#8217;t seem to be used that often. The setup could be simplified by snipping the 6th pin.

After looking in to it, it seems the PICkit 2 is discontinued.

<http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV164121>

There isn&#8217;t even a download link there for the software.

I found the source code a rather backwards way. The link is here:

[http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PICkit2\_PK2CMD\_WIN32\_SourceV1-21\_RC1.zip](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PICkit2_PK2CMD_WIN32_SourceV1-21_RC1.zip)

A newer device file is here (just overwrite):

<http://www.microchip.com/forums/download.axd?file=0;749972>

I discovered it by grabbing [this package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pk2cmd-plus), opening the PKGBUILD file. As it turns out, they still have the files on their website, they&#8217;re just not linked publicly. 

I&#8217;m not entirely convinced this is the latest version, but it is what I found.

Build like so.

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev

cd pk2cmd
cd pk2cmd
make linux
cp pk2cmd ../release     # we need to be alongside PK2DeviceFile.dat
cd ../release

# running as root is required, or you wont see the device
sudo ./pk2cmd -?v</pre>

That should output this:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >Executable Version:    1.21.00
Device File Version:   1.61.00
OS Firmware Version:   2.32.00


Operation Succeeded</pre>

You can then program a hex file. Before you start, figure out the PIC chip you&#8217;re programming, the name of your hex file, and adjust this accordingly.

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >sudo ./pk2cmd -PPIC18F43K20 -M -F DigiRule\ 18F43K20\ Modified\ 15\ Dec\ 2015.HEX 
</pre>
