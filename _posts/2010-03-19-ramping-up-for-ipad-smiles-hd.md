Alright! The iPad is coming soon, as is a brand new version of [**Smiles**](http://www.smiles-game.com).

As we speak I&#8217;m putting the finishing touches on [**Smiles HD**](http://www.smiles-game.com), the all new higher resolution and slightly redesigned iPhone game coming soon to the iPad.

Now, in the eyes of Apple I&#8217;m nobody special. So like many of you, I&#8217;ll be heading down to my local Apple store on launch day to pick me up an iPad&#8230; with one _slight_ difference.

I&#8217;m in Canada.

Why that matters is that only the US is getting them on April 3rd. So in order for [**Smiles HD**](http://www.smiles-game.com) to be in the App Store for (nearly) iPad launch, we&#8217;re going on a road trip!

Using Google&#8217;s excellent cartography skills, it looks like my trip to the nearest Apple store in the US will take roughly 2 hours. Not bad, but by &#8220;road trip&#8221; standards that&#8217;s rather light weight. And thanks to Apple&#8217;s reservation feature, this trip **wont** even require camping!

So as far as road trips go, this one wont impress any _real_ outdoors-men. But hey, I&#8217;m totally going out of my way for it. As I see it, **I need one**. Not as an Apple fan boy (though I do love gadgets), but for business.

## On making a living

Admittedly, my luck lately has been **really awesome**, but [free trips](/2010/03/18/mike-the-multi-winner-and-gdc-champion/) and [cars](/2010/02/03/the-intel-is-awesome-post/) don&#8217;t pay the bills. Heh, &#8220;Oh no! Poor you! If you need money, go sell your free car!&#8221;! Heh, I&#8217;d rather not, but I&#8217;m also not exactly in financial danger right now. The car is an asset available to me if something does happen. But right now, I&#8217;m very optimistic.

I&#8217;m an independent game developer, and I work full time on my own games. Being able to say that is really awesome, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m extremely proud of. Self employed, my own boss, earning an income by my rules. You could say I&#8217;m &#8220;living the dream&#8221;. It certainly is mine.

If you follow any other game developers, you&#8217;ll note that the majority of them tend to fall in to one of two groups. Creating a big game in a year+, or creating multiple small games in a year. Prior to **Smiles**, I definitely fell in to the 1st group ([2 year project that&#8217;s currently shelved](http://www.viddler.com/explore/PoVRAZOR/videos/11/)). But I don&#8217;t exactly fit in to either definition right now. **Smiles** was a 4 month game, and a year and a half later my news is still **Smiles HD** this and **Smiles** that.

What&#8217;s the deal?

**Smiles** is a bizarre success story. As far as describing its success level, I&#8217;d call it the perfect middle. Financially it&#8217;s done well enough that yes, it&#8217;s clear that I can make a living from my own games. My costs are low, and I don&#8217;t have a team or family to support, so I can justify any deficiency in profit as being &#8220;the first game&#8221;. It also has critical acclaim. 5&#8217;s, 4&#8217;s, 4.5&#8217;s, high regard on every notable game site that&#8217;s reviewed it. It was a finalist in the IGF Mobile for &#8220;Best Mobile Game&#8221; in 2009. And this year it _rocked_ Intel&#8217;s Atom Developer Challenge scoring 2nd in the early bird contest, and the &#8220;Elegance in Design&#8221; award. It even [nabbed a Bronze](/2009/12/23/i-was-4th-place/) in Samsung&#8217;s contest too. From all that, yes, I&#8217;d say **Smiles** is a success.

Am I a success? Absolutely.

Is my business a success though? Mmmmm&#8230; I&#8217;d probably shrug and say &#8220;meh&#8221; to that.

If you look to the first 3 year since leaving the day job, I earned nothing. Drained the savings a bunch, even threw down a decent chunk of change on outsourcing art. That&#8217;s fine though. As far as I was concerned, the money was meant for that. But though my costs are low, that money is still gone.

**Smiles** is an upward trend. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s on the cusp of success in a big way. I really think it just needs to get in front of its audience, and the rest will all fall in to place. Perhaps if I was a month earlier on iPhone, it would have already. But hey, that wouldn&#8217;t have been as interesting of a story. ðŸ™‚

**I am betting on iPad**.

I have zero assurance that Apple will do anything for me, but I am ready to make launch. They could very well just ignore me again, but I&#8217;ll be there from the beginning this time. I&#8217;m hopeful, but we&#8217;ll see how this goes.

Actually, I&#8217;m betting on a lot of things. Netbooks, I think there&#8217;s big potential there in the long term. Other mobile devices, absolutely. A certain portable gaming console I&#8217;ve been vaguely hinting at, definitely! As I see it, **Smiles** will either become a bigger success as a macro product (the sum of all it&#8217;s ports), or it will breakout somewhere (which hopefully ripples throughout the entire platform portfolio). As I&#8217;ve said, I&#8217;m very optimistic, and I&#8217;m ready.

I hope the Apple community isn&#8217;t offended by my dramatic lack of exclusivity. I do hope it acts to reinforce me and my companies significance, but really, I gotta eat.

I think my direction makes an interesting story. When I get to the end of this platforms blitz, I&#8217;ll have a plethora of new targets for my follow up projects (one game I&#8217;m expecting to start in the next few months). I sure hope this works out. I&#8217;d love to be able to give a talk at GDC some year and be able to say &#8220;yes, it worked&#8221;. My story is starting to get really good right now, here&#8217;s hoping for a happy ending.

## Coming up next for Smiles HD

Alright, now that I have that rant out of my system, lets talk details. I have a short term plan for the next few weeks I&#8217;m hoping to stick to. It looks something like this.

**#1. Next Week**: Release a preview/development log video.

As I&#8217;ve said, I&#8217;m finishing up the game now. I&#8217;m hoping to be done my TODO list well before the 3rd, and when I am, I think it&#8217;ll be a nice to do a behind the scenes demonstration of the game. A fun look at some of my iPad-less compromises. Essentially, to make my own small contribution to the iPad hype.

**#2. Before the 3rd**: Make press pack.

Pretty straight forward. I can take and make screenshots now, as well as draft up my sales pitch for the store, write a press release, etc. I suppose I can even release this early&#8230; I might just do that.

**#3. April 3rd**: Pick up iPad.

See above.

**#4. ASAP**: Submit to Apple.

I imagine Apple will officially allow submissions day 1, so sure, an option would be to just send it once we get the public SDK. Though I&#8217;ve played the game a lot, I wouldn&#8217;t feel right sending it without a good day of serious device testing. I&#8217;m not anticipating any real problems, though there&#8217;s always the possibility of being late overall, but even that currently seems unlikely. Best case, sent on Monday.

**#5. After that**: Make (quick) Trailer

Smiles was originally approved REALLY FAST, in about 2 days. Even more crazy, Smiles Zen took half a day to approve. So what I&#8217;ve learned from that is I need to be ready just in case. If I have some spare days, I may do some preparations. Use a proxy device to figure out where/how to hold it, briefly storyboard the trailer, or so on. Just so I&#8217;m able to _have something_ for the press once it&#8217;s ready. I feel bad that I&#8217;m not going to have time to give the press an early look at things, but nobody has iPad&#8217;s yet. We&#8217;ll all be playing this product launch by ear.

**#6. After that**: Websites

It&#8217;s a real shame, but I probably wont have a chance to redesign the **Sykhronics** and **Smiles** websites before launch. I&#8217;m hoping I do, but knowing me, that&#8217;ll come later. The [smiles-game.com](http://www.smiles-game.com) website is in dire need of updates, since it&#8217;s available for more than just the iPhone, and coming soon to several more devices. Same with the [Sykhronics](http://www.sykhronics.com) website, it&#8217;s still tagged as 2009, and makes no reference to my IGF and Intel success. I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;d have time to delegate the work either (assuming I had someone to delegate it to). It&#8217;ll just happen when it happens.

Besides finishing the game itself, I want to be doing everything I can for the press right now. My inbox and blog comments are open. If you have a question, feel free to contact me one of those ways. If I don&#8217;t respond to you directly, I&#8217;ll try to make some FAQ like posts on my blog here.
