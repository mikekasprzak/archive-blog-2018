The [September Tunneling](http://www.gametunnel.com/html/section-viewarticle-132.html) is up, and extra shiny. It was a light month, so we had to go back, and pick up a few from earlier in the year. Kisses, Zombie Smashers and Heavy Weapon being your older games. Personal favorites for this month would include The Strategist, Virus and The Goat in the Grey Fedora.

Doing the reviews like we do (blind, we don&#8217;t see each others scores until we&#8217;re all done), I always seem to have a game or two scoring regret. This month I&#8217;d have to say, the one game I \*should\* have given a higher score to would be The Goat in the Grey Fedora, the new Nick Bounty game. Even my comments clearly sound like I had a great time in the game, and I did. Ah well.
