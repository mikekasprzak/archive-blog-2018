So this will be an ongoing project.

I used to have some old PCs sitting in my closet. They take up a lot of space, and they&#8217;re heavy. So on a whim (as it always is), I decided to gut the PCs.

One of them, apparently I had already removed the power supply, so it was gone (if I remember, it was quite noisy, so no loss). The other still had its PSU, so I&#8217;ve selected it as the donor to my bench-top power supply project.

The PSU is effectively a 450 watt supply, more than enough for my needs. Also it&#8217;s one of the older supplies, so it appears to have a -5V wire (most modern supplies don&#8217;t have these anymore).

## Reference

Here&#8217;s a video breakdown of ATX power supplies that seems quite informative.

## Parts

I&#8217;m going to need parts. Banana plug sockets and some large resistors.

Something I&#8217;m thinking about doing is making one of these.

Ultimately the goal is to make an all in one, but I&#8217;m tempted to try building an external board you can plug an unmodified power supply in to.

I&#8217;m going to steal connectors and things from a couple obsolete motherboards. I&#8217;m never going to use these computers again anyway, so why not put them to good use (instead of the trash).
