It&#8217;s mid-day Saturday. I&#8217;m on a plane in less than 20 hours bound for San Francisco, to join the celebration that is GDC (the Game Developer&#8217;s Conference).

It&#8217;s a packed week for me. The past couple years I attended back-to-back Indie Game Summit talks on Monday+Tuesday, but this year I&#8217;m planning to jump around a bit more. My iPod touch calendar is filled with the most interesting talks that my Summits pass will let me in to, including some Wednesday->Friday. Should be fun.

Tuesday night, we&#8217;re having another Ludum Dare meetup at GDC, [detail here](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/02/17/ludum-dare-meetup-in-sf-on-march-1st/).

Friday we&#8217;re looking to have an impromptu GameJam. We&#8217;re still ironing out the details, but check the [Ludum Dare site](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) for details.

That, plus various talks, meetings, and good &#8216;ol hanging-out/chatting with fellow developers. I&#8217;m looking forward to this year being a nice somewhat relaxed GDC for me &#8211; No managing an exhibit booth, or getting (\*ahem\*) confident for 3x on camera interviews &#8211; Just straight-up GDC&#8217;ing.

Looking briefly at my prior post, it does seem I&#8217;m well behind schedule (hehe). Lots has been going on, but none of it finished yet, so here the blog sat for nearly 2 months. I&#8217;m _literally_ writing this post just to get something in for February, hehe. I wish I had something to photograph and show, but I&#8217;m just not ready to announce some of the crazy new stuff yet.

Ah well, back to packing&#8230;
