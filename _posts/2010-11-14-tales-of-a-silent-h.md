For whatever reason, I was inspired to start playing with logo designs. There&#8217;s no new decisions to be seen here in this post, just some ideas I&#8217;m playing with (and rejecting).

I actually used to make my own typography and font designs, one such example is this:

<center>
  <img src="/content/sykforumlogo2003.gif" />
</center>

You can see more examples of [prior logos here](/2005/11/27/classic-logos/).

For [the past 5 years](/2005/11/26/logo-rhythm/) I&#8217;ve been using this:

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SykLogo_Brown-640x118.png" alt="" title="SykLogo_Brown" width="640" height="118" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3457" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SykLogo_Brown-640x118.png 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SykLogo_Brown-450x83.png 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SykLogo_Brown.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SykLogo_Brown.png)

I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever really liked it, but it was _good enough_. The thing is, it **WAS** good enough, not so much anymore (or in other words, I&#8217;m bored of it).

Neither that or Smiles use fonts I created, with the exception of the Smiles logo and PAUSE/UNDO text.

<div id="attachment_3454" style="max-width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PTLogo3.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PTLogo3-640x288.png" alt="" title="PTLogo3" width="640" height="288" class="size-large wp-image-3454" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PTLogo3-640x288.png 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PTLogo3-450x202.png 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PTLogo3.png 1311w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Smiles... it's a logo, and the only original typography design I've done in years
  </p>
</div>

So seeing how the 5 year anniversary of Sykhronics Entertainment is coming up, as well as some new projects, I think it&#8217;s time to start thinking about the branding.

In the &#8220;old days&#8221; (1998-2005), Sykhronics was an all-caps logo. When it became my dayjob, it went lowercase. For the new logo, I&#8217;m thinking about going back to the caps look, and maybe making my own font design again.

Before I go there though, I wanted to play around with some general type ideas.

What is **<u>definitely</u> not obvious**, Sykhronics is pronounced &#8220;Sigh Cron Icks&#8221; (Sy Khron Ics). It&#8217;s a invented word of mine that, for whatever reason, has a silent **H** in it. And for whatever reason, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever done anything to emphasize (or rather, de-emphasize) the H. I could have just axed it (I do own the H-less domains), but it&#8217;s such an absurd word anyways, I left it in.

So the majority of my experimenting today is with the H.

Or as text:

  <font size="+1">SYKHRONICS . . . . . SYK<strong>H</strong>RONICS . . . . . <strong>SYK</strong>H<strong>RONICS</strong></p> 
  
  <p>

  </p>

    The circle designs, there&#8217;s no hidden message there (MOONS!), just that the logos are all very wide. Whatever I design should last me the next 5 years (at least), so one idea I&#8217;ve been toying with is styling it to suit the game. The circle is a sort-of guide, showing where the per game identity &#8220;thing&#8221; would go. If I was to style it to Smiles, it&#8217;d probably have the Mushroom character curling and peeking over.

    Other things I tried above was a lower line on the H. I kinda like it, but I also realized later I kinda like the lower case h too. The lower case H version works well in actual text too. There&#8217;s also the faint gray and outline H versions, which I think give a good contrast.

    And then there&#8217;s &#8220;Tiny H&#8221;. Hmmm.
  </p>

    Again, no decisions. I wanted to make these mockup images for me, and put them somewhere I&#8217;d see them (and no reason <em>not</em> to share).
