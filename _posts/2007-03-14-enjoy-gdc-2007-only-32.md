I think I&#8217;ve already posted about this everywhere, except here. If you&#8217;re like me, and decided to skip out on Travel, Hotel, and admission to GDC, you can get the meat of the event for a fair $32.

$8 gets you a day (about 6 hours of talks) for either the Indie Games Summit or the Casual Games Summit. Nice. Buy &#8216;em all for nearly 24 hours of interesting discussions and talks. XBLA postmortems, distribution, discussion on the BS of innovative games, and much more.

And GameSpot has done us the favor of taping and putting up the IGF Awards, and the Game Developers Choice awards mixed in to one long presentation. Surprisingly, several &#8220;indie&#8221; games made it in to the non IGF awards.

If you want more, you can dig through the talks at _the rest_ of GDC. Those will set you back another $8 per talk. You can be selective this time though.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

One of the Ninja Bee peeps gave a fascinating talk there about setting up an [LLC per game project](http://store.cmpgame.com/product.php?id=1887&cat=56) to fund it. I still have many more talks to dig through myself.

And that&#8217;s all folks.
