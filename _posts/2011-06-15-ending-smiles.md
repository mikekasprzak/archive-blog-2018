It is ending. For real.

**June 23rd** is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.

Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary. I have one key version of the game left, MeeGo, which is done but I&#8217;ve been running in to issues automating Linux packaging (stupid permissions). I have a short list of other things I&#8217;m going to try and quickly do, with Thursday June 23rd as the &#8220;real work&#8221; cutoff. Then &#8220;Smiles Time&#8221; should finally be reduced to only a day every few weeks&#8230; maybe months. Sounds too good to be true. ðŸ˜€

I&#8217;m not ready to do a proper postmortem or retrospective. I&#8217;ll do one of those when I&#8217;m slacking new-project work, specifically, in the mood to write instead of do. ðŸ™‚

I-MA go get some lunch now.
