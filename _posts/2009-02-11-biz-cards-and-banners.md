Sent off my draft over the weekend. Since then, I&#8217;ve been up to some biz stuff. Buying ad space on a few iPhone websites. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s helping just yet, but hey, more exposure is more exposure. ðŸ™‚

[148 Apps](http://www.148apps.com), [Slide to Play](http://www.slidetoplay.com), and one more site which I wont say because I paid for CPM (number of impressions as opposed to time). ðŸ˜‰

Last night and today I&#8217;ve been working at designing some business cards for myself. I&#8217;d like to give a shout out to [Thomas &#8220;Dr.Petter&#8221;](http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/) and the [Ludum Dare peeps](http://www.ludumdare.com) for telling me my design was shite several times, which ultimately led to this reasonable design.

And the version I&#8217;ll have at my IGF pavilion.

Next step will be to find a local printer to produce them for me.

That&#8217;s all for now. I&#8217;ll probably include a website design somewhere between now and GDC.

Ta ta.
