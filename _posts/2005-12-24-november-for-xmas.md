The [roundup for November](http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=407) is up, just in time for the big day December 25th. 10 again this time.

Many good games this month. Land of Legends, the fantasy strategy game in the top spot, followed by the wildlife park simulator Venture Africa, a hardcore space trading sim Flatspace II, an aquarium store simulator Fish Tycoon, and a slick little soccer player simulator New Star Soccer 3. Good stuff.
