This posting has been filled. Thanks everyone.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

Here&#8217;s a little job posting that I&#8217;ve started to circulate.

[edit] Edited, &#8217;cause it was rather technical and mean sounding.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

Hi there,

We&#8217;re looking for a skilled 2D illustrator or animator for a 2 month contract, to start some time in February. The work can be done remotely. This is a full time contract, and I expect it to be on par with industry wages.

We&#8217;re on schedule to finish the game by the summer. The game is being developed for High Definition and Standard Definition TV resolutions. It&#8217;s played from a side view, like a classic 2D platformer game (Super Mario Bros, etc&#8230;).

Visually, we&#8217;re aiming for a strong, smooth, possibly iconic vector illustration look for the game. 2D animated characters on layered scrolling 2D scenery. Behind the scenes is a capable 3D game engine, and 2D physics engine, though we&#8217;d like the game to have a 2D animated feel.

The game features scenes of cartoon violence. No gore, just something in the vein of classic Road Runner cartoons.

To get an idea what the job would entail, you&#8217;ll be working with us initially to establish the background look. Then you&#8217;ll be working with the 3D modeler and level designer, designing backgrounds and foreground parts for the game, breaking them down for the 3D modeler to reproduce in our tools, and creating any textures needed to achieve the look. Then a similar process for the menus. After that, we&#8217;d like to work with you on the character, props, and get your feedback on the HUD and other things found in various parts of the game.

To be able to test the game, you&#8217;re going to need a relatively modern PC running Windows XP with a relatively modern video card.

Experience with Flash, ToonBoom, Blender, or any 3D experience is a plus.

To start, I&#8217;d like to see portfolios, and any emphasis on background works would be beneficial. Prop, menu, and character work is a plus. You can send them to jobs@sykhronics.com. I&#8217;d prefer website links, but if you&#8217;d like to e-mail something, try not to let it exceed 10 MB.

Candidates we like, we&#8217;ll be getting back to for a quote in the next couple weeks. Anyone we don&#8217;t get back to, my apologies, but we have a specific style we&#8217;re trying to nail with this game.

Thanks,

Mike Kasprzak
