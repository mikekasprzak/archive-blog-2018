Since the summer I&#8217;ve been chatting with Microsoft about bringing Smiles to Windows Phone 7. 

In early September, I was invited to an event &#8220;Windows Phone 7 Blogger Night&#8221; in Toronto.

    Typical me, blurry and in motion. Here I am demoing Smiles on the TV (all of the touch-screen PC's were taken). Also, note to self: don't wear shorts to press events... you stand out too much in the after event photography.

In addition, I make a brief appearance in this video.

Heh, this might be one of my worst appearances on video (Mr. Shiny forehead), but fortunately it&#8217;s very quick. ðŸ˜‰

A couple weeks ago I sent a playable to my Microsoft rep, and it was to make an appearance at Ottawa Coffee and Code event.

And from today, here&#8217;s that gameplay video.
