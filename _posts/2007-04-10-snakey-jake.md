An interesting concept for design people. I&#8217;m calling them **clicking platformers**. Everybody&#8217;s played Wik, so I wont talk about Wik. This is a game I came across today called Snakey Jake.

It&#8217;s your usual casual game fare as far as graphics and polish are concerned. What I was expecting was a &#8220;click on a spot&#8221; sort of game and he&#8217;ll move to that spot, but it&#8217;s actually click on the platform and he&#8217;ll move to the nearest place on the platform. Either by slithering or jumping, where appropriate. It&#8217;s a good example of an intelligently simplified control scheme, as I expect several designers will be toying with more in the years to come.

Personally, I don&#8217;t like this variation of control. True, it&#8217;s harder to make mistakes since you can&#8217;t click anywhere, but it annoys me as a player. Mostly because I&#8217;m a core gamer, and I&#8217;d imagine you could do some really interesting things with this gameplay style without the platform restriction. It also imposes a restriction of &#8220;you can only click on platforms that you can safely jump to from this platform&#8221;. Good for casual gamers, but not so much for me when I&#8217;m in the mood for a suicide jump. I&#8217;m also totally missing the opportunity for a conversation with myself about how I could or should have sooooo made that jump. Boo.

If I was still doing the roundup, I&#8217;d be bouncing back and forth between 6 and 8. Higher because of design merit, &#8217;cause I think it&#8217;s a notable game as far as game design for casual gamers, and the only other game I can think of to compare it to is Wik. Lower because I personally didn&#8217;t like the decision to go with platform clicking, as a personal gamer preference. I&#8217;d muddle over that for a day if I wasn&#8217;t behind schedule, or an hour if I was the one holding us back.
