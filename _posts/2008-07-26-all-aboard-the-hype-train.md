August 1st, 2005. Three years ago this Friday. I was a burned out coder that left behind his jobs as Programmer, Senior and Lead Programmer, and eventually Technical Director at various game companies. A dozen handheld, mobile, and console titles to my name. A lifetime of game fascination and experience.

Next, I was starting my own.

Now, I&#8217;m not [the](http://www.bigbluebubble.com/) [only](http://www.oceanmedia.hr/) [one](http://www.tuskinteractive.com/) of my former co-workers to do this, and certainly not the [only](http://www.casuallyhardcore.com/) one, but I didn&#8217;t want to do it the same as we&#8217;ve done before. Setting up a studio, hiring a staff, possibly seeking work for hire. No thanks.

As an idealist, naive, and still reasonably young, I wasn&#8217;t ready to give up the dream we all have when we get in to games. Make what **I** want, and make a living from it. No publisher&#8217;s money looming over my head. No licenses selling on brand recognition alone. No (more) Barbie games.

Despite appearances, I&#8217;ve been up to a lot of stuff. [Talked](/2008/03/01/engines-names-and-evolution-part-1/) [about](/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-2/) [some](/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-3/) of them, kept [quiet](/2007/02/19/pitch-video-trailer-postmortem/) about others, even mysteriously [hired a contractor](/2007/01/30/2d-illustrator-or-animator-needed/) in the midst of it all.

Finally (and actually), the first result is just a week or two away.

Three years.

And **oh boy** is it going to be a disappointment.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

But, it _finally_ starts.
