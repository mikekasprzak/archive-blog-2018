Still doin&#8217; the perpetual &#8220;one more week&#8221;, but I&#8217;m close. Very close.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

If things go according to plan, we&#8217;ll be beta next Monday (September 1st). I want to sit on it a couple days and test the crap out of it, just to be sure it&#8217;s all good. Then off to Apple by Wednesday-Friday.

I wanted the promo+box art done a couple weeks ago, but I amusingly keep pushing it back. I told myself I&#8217;d finish it this weekend, but hey, nope. I&#8217;ve got some good sketches, just nothing digital yet.

I&#8217;ve done nearly everything reasonable I wanted in the game (with a few little things to slip in this week). I ended up spending a couple days last week making some alternative art. Turned out much better than the original set, which kinda makes me want to go back and redo the original. It&#8217;s fine though&#8230; Mike, listen! Just leave it! Ship it!

So bare with the vague just a little while longer.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

Besides taking some well deserved rest, I suppose I&#8217;m torn with what comes next. Immediately following, I&#8217;ll have to pull together a proper website and press pack for the game. But after all that, I have the option of diving right in to Project 2, or to spend some time building some tools, libraries, etc.

I have a list of little things I&#8217;d have loved to have whilst developing this game, that certainly would come in handy for future games. I suppose I&#8217;m in a bit of a tooly mindset right now. That might make a fun blogging project.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

[Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) 12&#8217;s voting finishes up tonight. I&#8217;ll be around for my usual administrative contributions.

Then next week I announce the theme for Mini LD #3, hosted by me. I really hope I can get the game shipped out before Friday (September 5th), so I can at least veg for a day.

Mind you, administrating a compo isn&#8217;t that much work (hit a few switches, make some posts, and announce the theme), but still.

You know, I could be vegging. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
