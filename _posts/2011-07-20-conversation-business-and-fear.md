From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about&#8230; well&#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.

The first begins on the subject of &#8220;big games are extremely risky&#8221;, despite doing one myself right now.

I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures.

Finally, I explicitly **DON&#8217;T** apologize for fear mongering, because we need it.

And there we have 17 some minutes of rant. I&#8217;m left feeling a little worried about some of the things said, but I&#8217;m glad to have said them.

Today is Wednesday now, so like I touch upon in that first video, I might have an announcement&#8230; or not&#8230; CMON YES!!!! I WANNA HAVE GOOD NEWS!!! RRRRRRRR!!!!
