Hello! If you&#8217;re here, you probably saw me mention that I&#8217;ll be looking for work in 2017.

I haven&#8217;t had to look for a job since 1999, so I don&#8217;t have a resume/portfolio handy. If you follow my work, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;m very busy right now working on **Ludum Dare**, and I will be for the rest of the year. Formal stuff is going to have to wait until then.

But thanks to **Ludum Dare**, I know that a number of people do follow my work. So I wrote this to confirm that yes, I am looking for work, and give folks an opportunity to reach-out early. My apologies if I don&#8217;t get back right away.

So here&#8217;s a brief post about myself. If you&#8217;re feeling nosy, you can browse my public [GitHub](http://github.com/povrazor) repo, or even **this blog**, but this blog is an anomaly (some parts a decade out of date).

These days my blog is more of a notebook; Collecting thoughts and details on topics I&#8217;ve researched, so that I can more easily repeat them or pick-up where I left off.

## About Me

I run [Ludum Dare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare). I didn&#8217;t start it, but I am its caretaker. I have been a part of it since the beginning (2002).

Besides that, starting in 1999 I worked for several game companies over the years (Sandbox Studios, Digital Illusions Canada, and Big Blue Bubble). I&#8217;ve done contracting as well. I&#8217;ve shipped more than a dozen commercial games (mostly licensed games, including a few more Barbie games than I&#8217;d care to admit); Written lots of low-level C and C++ code for Nintendo and Sony consoles, and a few games entirely in Assembly. I&#8217;ve also written lots of OpenGL, ES, and SDL code, shaders, and ported code to dozens of popular and exotic mobile and embedded platforms (most don&#8217;t exist anymore). I can 3D math, build engines, assemble a toolchain, and wrangle my way through physics. I&#8217;m formerly the Technical Director of a large Canadian game studio (Big Blue Bubble), and I ran a &#8220;financially underwhelming&#8221; indie studio for many years. That was until this side project of mine (Ludum Dare) became my focus.

I&#8217;m based in London Ontario Canada (yes, there&#8217;s a London in Canada).

I enjoy doing low-level, performance, and optimization work. I&#8217;m at-home on Linux, but spent many years on Windows using Cygwin. I&#8217;m not a fan of &#8220;black boxes&#8221;. I like to know how everything works, and know exactly what to expect. Thanks to Ludum Dare, I also know a lot about PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Linux Servers, and all those trendy web technologies and standards that are all-the-rage. I like Vulkan and VR, but I haven&#8217;t done anything real with them.

In my spare time (ha) I toy with a bunch of other projects. I like to dabble with Arduinos, Electronics, Retro Computers, exotic SBC&#8217;s (Single Board Computers), and IOT devices. I get nerdy about getting the most out of the least expensive devices (the old cost vs power ratio), and I think eSports is cool (I used to be really in to Starcraft 2 and Smash).

I&#8217;m a pretty good cook too. ðŸ˜€

I&#8217;m looking for something interesting. Not necessarily gamedev, but who knows. Something compatible with me having my own projects and commitments, like Ludum Dare. I can&#8217;t relocate to the US, but I can visit (I have no diploma. I dropped out of college to take my first industry gig). I really don&#8217;t know what options I have, but I&#8217;ve done soooo much low level and backend work, that despite industry trends, taking a Unity gig just seems like a waste (I&#8217;ve barely touched it, and I have &#8220;opinions&#8221; of C# ðŸ˜‰ ). 

To summarize, I&#8217;m looking for: &#8220;interesting&#8221;, &#8220;flexible&#8221;, and &#8220;not Unity&#8221;.
