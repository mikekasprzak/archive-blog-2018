I did miss my June 23rd target date, but with good reason: I started on computer upgrades and setting up my new Laptop early. ðŸ˜€

But yes, as you approach the end of something, there are always things you forget about that still need to be done.

Like this, a Computer and TV-System appropriate trailer for Smiles HD (i.e. without entire screen rotating):



As you can see, that is now done.

Beyond this, I have 2 more versions to submit; Both are ready to go, 1 just needs uploading, the other I need to verify the packages. Both should be out of my hands in the next couple days.

That&#8217;s all for now. I&#8217;m taking the rest of the weekend off. Ha ha!
