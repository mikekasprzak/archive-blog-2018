I like [Slamdance](http://www.slamdance.com/games/). I entered PuffBOMB last year, and was [a finalist](/2005/12/17/slamdance-2006-casual-finalist/) for the casual game award. Since then, I&#8217;ve been excited that a more &#8220;artful&#8221; game competition was beginning to take off. Winners receive a funky ugly dog statuette. Cool!  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

Then a [controversial game was pulled](http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000717.shtml). Things are [not going well](http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000719.shtml) now.

It&#8217;s a real shame, and I hope something good comes from the controversy, rather than developing in to more [Jack Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Thompson_(attorney)) style heat for our industry. The situation is all bad, no matter how many games pull out or stay in. I don&#8217;t even think Slamdance changing their minds would help at this point, regardless of the [intentions of the letter](http://grandtextauto.gatech.edu/2007/01/08/from-slamdance-games-finalists/).

I could and would really like to go off more on this, but I can&#8217;t afford to. I&#8217;ll be cheering and booing from the sidelines. Go team!
