Oh don&#8217;t be scared baby, I&#8217;m still here.

Yes, it seems I&#8217;ve been neglecting posting. On the plus side, there&#8217;s been some major progress, but equally major distractions. Since apparently leaving a job clearly means &#8220;2 month vacation&#8221;, there I was back at Big Blue for a week. All was good though. I was asked to help a struggling project meet a milestone, and that seemed to go well. Twas also nice to hang out with the guys there again, a fine group I must say.

As for progress, last weekend I hit an internal milestone. In other words, my 2D physics engine is functioning exactly as I wanted it for our dear friend PuffBOMB, and some other little prototype games that may show up. Funky doo!

Excited and shocked by the previous note, I&#8217;ve got some round upin&#8217; to finish. Oohh&#8230; Trash&#8230; Mmmm&#8230;
