Alright, so the clock says it&#8217;s Friday now. According to my whiteboard, that&#8217;s 29 days before I leave for the Game Developers Conference. Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It&#8217;s also an important turning point for **Smiles** as a product and a brand.  Lets talk about that.

[**Smiles**](http://www.smiles-game.com) has been a reasonable success.

Financially it&#8217;s no [iShoot](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/01/profits-from-ishoot-iphone-game-cause-developer-to-quit-job.ars), but it&#8217;s done decently. If I hadn&#8217;t already left my cozy mainstream game industry job, I&#8217;d be seriously considering it. Long term scribblings and business plans would have filled my notebooks

Game industry notoriety wise, it&#8217;s an [IGF Mobile finalist](http://www.igfmobile.com/02finalists.html) (for best game no less). An IGF nod is exactly what I aimed for as I stepped out of the usual 9-6 game industry day job.

And the game has been praised by **every** site that has reviewed it.

It&#8217;s everything you shoot for as a independent developer.

The problem is the exposure and sustainability.

**Smiles** thus far has lived entirely outside every top 100 list in the App Store. If you check [mobclix](http://www.mobclix.com), you&#8217;ll note that the highest it&#8217;s been able to achieve is #146 on the free arcade games chart (**Free Smiles**). As a result, it survives entirely on word of mouth.

I&#8217;ve since put some banner advertisements on a few of the larger iPhone sites, but real traffic seems to come only from distinct news posts about your game. Living outside the charts, every post is a lifeline. I can hope for that day Apple decides to feature me, but I shouldn&#8217;t hold my breath.

At the moment, and with GDC on the horizon, I have a good block of pre and post conference publicity available to me. That&#8217;s maybe a good 2 months of spotlight. But after that, it&#8217;s back to being lost in the vast Sea of iPhone apps.

So what&#8217;s next?

One option is to continue supporting the game, new updates, features, and so on.  The problem is that **Smiles** as a product already contains arguably well over **$5** worth of content and extras, and asking for more as an unknown would be murder. Asking for **$5** is already far too much in the eyes of the majority. I had to split the game in half (**Smiles Zen**, **Smiles Drop**) to show the value of the product. There&#8217;s always room for minor updates, but you should always be moving forward.

The other option, start game #2. Good in the long term, as multiple products tend to help sell each other. But in the short term, sales would die down to a crawl if I didn&#8217;t keep the exposure up. That wont kill me, but why let that happen?

Alright, so the 3rd option (or rather, what are you doing)?

Actually, there&#8217;s 2 things I&#8217;m going to do.

The first, I need to **improve the brand and marketing**. Not exactly spam the internet with more banners, but improve what and how I speak to the customer. My iTunes/App Store/all of descriptions are extremely vague. I approached the game marketing originally by pushing the game as mere cheerful and friendly product. Easy to play, and some actual depth to it. But that&#8217;s the same angle every other matching/casual game takes.

**Smiles** is an IGF Mobile finalist. That means there&#8217;s _something_ special about the game. Until you sit down and really play it, you&#8217;re completely unaware that the game is actually different. That&#8217;s one mistake I&#8217;ve made.

Many of us gamers have fond memories of puzzle games. Tetris, Dr.Mario, Puzzle Bobble, etc. But not everyone has that same experience with Bejeweled. For many, that&#8217;s where our gaming tastes divided. Heck, I don&#8217;t care for it myself either. It&#8217;s slow. That&#8217;s what I changed in **Smiles**. I can&#8217;t be the first one first to have done it, but in my _research_ reviewing games for [Game Tunnel](http://www.gametunnel.com) I never found one that at least did this. If I am, shame on you casual games industry.

Conventional &#8220;gamerized&#8221; casual games often hurt the truly casual appeal with timers and clocks. That&#8217;s stress. Many casual gamers play to relax and unwind. How can you do that when stressed? So I threw away the clocks and found ways to challenge you at a pace you control.

Also touch screens are intuitive. The control scheme of single touch actions on iPhone really makes it shine. Most people (especially new gamers) can move a finger faster and more accurately than they can with a mouse.

It all ties together in to a great little product, tuned specifically for the iPhone. The user base speaks highly of the game, which is great. But it&#8217;s a user base that grows only as new media outlets cover it at a reasonably frequency.

So this is goal number one. I need to improve the image of the game, be clearer what you&#8217;re getting as a consumer, give a stronger identity for media to grasp on to. It&#8217;s something special truly living in the obscurity in the App Store.  This is in preparation for the second part.

The second part, a **cross platform strategy**. In other words, make it available everywhere that&#8217;s practical.

To start, that mean PC, Mac and Linux. Actually, that&#8217;s already well underway. **Smiles** was actually developed on Windows and Linux, in addition to the Mac.

I come from a console game development background, so this has become standard stuff for me.

I spent a day this week troubleshooting graphics issues on an Intel GMA 945 graphics chipset. That works now, so the game will run on any reasonably recent PC. It&#8217;s hardware accelerated, relying heavily on fill rate. There are a hand full of changes that need to be made to suit the PC platforms, but it&#8217;s extremely playable as is.

So PC, Mac, and Linux are the immediate future of the **Smiles** game and brand. The goal being to expand the potential market before moving on to the next thing. Most the work is done already, it&#8217;s just a good couple weeks and some infrastructure away (not that I have that much time between now and GDC).

In addition, I&#8217;d like to pursue a **console version**. The original game assets _are_ _HD 1080p ready_, though currently sized for the iPhone. The control scheme, while less efficient, could certainly be adapted to a D-Pad/Analogue Stick. And yeah, I realize a mere port to console is often not enough.

The console part may sound a bit &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221;, but I&#8217;m actually quite familiar with the pitch process&#8230; nearly an _expert_ at turned down projects. 😉 Being a &#8220;home office&#8221; developer may work against me (7+1 prior Nintendo and a PlayStation game aside), but hey, I&#8217;m serious about this.

I&#8217;ll be at GDC in March, where anything can happen. I&#8217;m a game industry veteran with [12 very real](/about/) products in my portfolio, a low burn rate, and I know how to outsource if needed. I don&#8217;t need a job or an agent, just an avenue. Come find me at the IGF Mobile pavilion, I&#8217;d love to chat. 🙂

And there it is. Certainly a lot more blunt than I&#8217;ve been, but it&#8217;s &#8220;no more Mr. Nice Mike&#8221; time.  😀
