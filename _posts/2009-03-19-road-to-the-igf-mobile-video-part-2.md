I&#8217;m back. This time, I&#8217;m ready for GDC!

Come take an early look at the madness I&#8217;m bringing with me to the conference.



As you can probably guess from the lack of Smiles PC/HD progress posts, I will not be demoing it at the conference. I am still bringing both laptops though. The _big one_ will be doing something _else_ instead.

Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
