I must _really_ enjoy being vague.

Three reasons for this. #1, I&#8217;m an ass. #2, The art is going through a major (final) overhaul at the moment. #3, I kinda don&#8217;t want my loyal viewer to pre-judge the game yet.

So the obvious answer, yes, it&#8217;s an iPhone game. Analysis of the mosaic well tell you a few things about the game, but to my credit, it&#8217;s not a clone. It&#8217;s a few things, but not a clone. Yep! Not a clone. In the _unlikely_ circumstance it is a clone, then I&#8217;ve never played the original, and they deserve my praise.

The game is in it&#8217;s final stages. &#8220;Alpha&#8221; would be a good term for it. Feature complete top to bottom, but since I&#8217;m working solo, that&#8217;s put all the final art production and finishing touches between Alpha and Beta. The bulk of this is menus, which I initially expected (i.e. hoped) would take a week, but it may take a &#8216;little&#8217; longer.

Ahh the infamous &#8220;Next Week + X&#8221; gold date.

I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;ll have the promotional artwork ready to show here next weekend. In the mean time, if you want **more** vague update remarks, you can follow me on Twitter.

You can also catch tease part 2 there, i.e. my theme. And also vaguely learn about other mystery projects in development before this, and some movies I&#8217;ve seen. Oooh!

Fun fun.
