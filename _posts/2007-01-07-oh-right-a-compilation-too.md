 <img src="/content/ig2compilation.gif" align="right" />It seems I missed the memo.

The 2nd _Independent Games_ compilation [was released](http://www.amazon.com/IG-Independent-Games-V-2-0/dp/B000IN4VC2/ref=pd_bxgy_vg_text_b/105-5213483-4312439) back in September (25th), and that PuffBOMB game I seem to talk about all the time was included.

As well, there was a set of concept art included in the package. Said art can also be seen [right here](/2006/07/22/puffbomb-concept-art-2003-2004/).

I suppose I should go find a way to acquire a copy, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m not sure what happened to a complimentary one.

And in other news&#8230; I&#8217;m adding another sentence to this post so to not screw up the formating, thanks to my overly large image. Mission accomplished.
