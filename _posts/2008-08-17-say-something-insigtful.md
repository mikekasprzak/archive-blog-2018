Yikes, it&#8217;s a weekend again already! Sunday too! Ack!

Rule of thumb. When Mike says game will be out in a week or two, assume month. Then assume longer.

Ahem.

There&#8217;s always the chance that this mysterious iPhone game may destroy my &#8216;cred&#8217; as a physics guy. Though, I&#8217;ve been doing some fun stuff in it to rectify that.

I&#8217;ve found several uses for effects based on verlet and spring physics, even though the game lives in a world of tiles. When you can constrain the motion to a single axis, springs and integration really simplifies. Magnitude becomes a mere subtraction, and a spring a mere scalar for the magnitude. Fun stuff.

Just this morning (Saturday) I added something vaguely like a water/pond simulation. A 2D spring system that creates ripples. But it&#8217;s actually a collection of 1D springs that influence their neighbors. A proper 2D cloth would break your the perception of things. In the end it&#8217;s pure eye candy, but still.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />

It&#8217;s stuff like this that makes me wish the GBA wasn&#8217;t dead. When restricted to an axis, it&#8217;s only a couple subtracts, adds, and multiplies. No square roots to be seen. And for some of the funkier effects (Jello), only a few divides (ARM7&#8217;s can&#8217;t divide).

Then again, go ahead and stay dead GBA. I&#8217;m loving the freedom of having crap-tons of textured quads.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

Also, [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspire_One) are pretty cool. My brother picked one up from Future Shop, and it took only a couple hours to get my SDL OpenGL PC build working on it&#8217;s Linux (was all just figuring out the names of packages that were missing). Just over 2 lbs too! I&#8217;m soooo grabbing one once this game ships.

[Gamma 3D](http://www.kokoromi.org/gamma3d) compo for October, then in November in Montreal. Geez&#8230; I _really_ need to start doing semi-local game industry events.

Why do you have to be _2 whole_ hours away Toronto!?  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

I guess that&#8217;s what Greyhound and Audiobooks are for.
