I&#8217;m actually in the middle of a rather large post, but I still felt this was worth noting (while inappropriate for the other post). [PuffBOMB](http://www.puffbomb.com), my explosive little freeware game is currently featured on [GameJolt](http://www.gamejolt.com).

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PBFeature-640x306.png" alt="" title="PBFeature" width="640" height="306" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2489" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PBFeature-640x306.png 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PBFeature-450x215.png 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PBFeature.png 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PBFeature.png)

[GameJolt](http://www.gamejolt.com) is a unique games website that&#8217;s a bit like a &#8220;Kongregate&#8221; for freeware. I put PuffBOMB up there some time last week to try it out, and it&#8217;s pretty cool. 

The site has a neat feature for downloading and playing PC games right from the browser. Give them a zip file and tell it which file in the zip is the executable, and you&#8217;re laughing.

Anyways, back to the BIG post. ðŸ˜‰
