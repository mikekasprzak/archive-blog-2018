Rather spontaneously, I decided to put **Smiles Drop** on sale for New Years.

So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab **Smiles Drop** for the extremely reasonable price of **$1.99** (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy **Smiles Zen** after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on **Smiles**. Well&#8230; you might save a penny buying separately, but still.

Working on an update for Smiles too. Should include a battery save feature, that should improve battery life for a lower framerate. Fun fun.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

Smiles&#8217; art was featured in a nonstandard place. In an article on game art.

<http://www.gamedev.net/reference/art/features/CoderGameArt/>

Awesome. ðŸ˜€

The article is about how a programmer can cheat to make decent game art, though Smiles is referenced as _a good example_ of shape.

In other news&#8230; yeah&#8230; I guess the default theme has hung around for a while longer than expected. One of these days I&#8217;ll make something cool and slap it on the top&#8230; followed by fattening up the theme a bit.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

Recently I&#8217;ve been playing around with a new digital painting app, [Paint Tool Sai](http://sai.detstwo.com/sai/index). As a [Paint Shop Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_Shop_Pro) user (hoping to find a replacement), I have to say the toolset is extremely familiar. It lacks font features so it&#8217;s no replacement for PSP, but the **workflow is incredible**. It&#8217;s possible I may stop using [Sketchbook Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_SketchBook_Pro) and start using this in it&#8217;s stead.

Slight language barrier, but I think I love it.

I&#8217;ll have more to say about Paint Tool Sai as I put it in to production.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

Also writing. Yes, writing. Just not writing blog stuff it seems.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

I&#8217;ll leave you with a teaser&#8230; since I want to try out the upload feature.

Not a project per se, but proof that I&#8217;m exploring ideas. Well, more than anything, proof that I&#8217;m playing with Blender again. Figuring out how you&#8217;d make 3D tiles&#8230; for backgrounds of course. I still have to do 2D characters. That&#8217;s just the way I am. ðŸ™‚
