It&#8217;s been 2 weeks, and much has happened.

As the topic suggests, **Smiles Drop** and **Smiles Zen** are now both available. **$2.99** each, or save **$1** by getting **Smiles** (**$4.99**).

So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />

As for blog content, I&#8217;m half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days&#8230; and I sorta haven&#8217;t gone back to finish the post yet.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

I sent a bunch of e-mails out late Monday night to announce the full availability of _the split_. I got some response. I&#8217;ll list these later with the new reviews.

Speaking of writing, I should be contributing a chapter to a book. More details to follow in the coming months.

As for the last week and the weekend, I&#8217;ve been busy backing up, formatting, rebuilding my server and workstation PC&#8217;s. Server&#8217;s back up and humming away (short an SVN problem). Workstation&#8230; heh&#8230; I guess that&#8217;s in progress. It&#8217;s backed up, but I keep putting off the format.

Main reason for putting it off, Ludum Dare 13.

[Ludum Dare 13](http://www.ludumdare.com) is this weekend. Theme voting is on right now. Then at the usual 11 PM EST it goes live, and 48 hours later you have a game. This is the first one in a long time I&#8217;m making the effort to enter. Things have &#8220;sort of&#8221; calmed down. At least, calm enough that I&#8217;m able to make such plans. Heh, one of these days I&#8217;ll get around to finishing the site.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

In related [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) news, we&#8217;re obviously all a little silly. [Towlr](http://www.towlr.com) is back and bigger than ever.

    Currently there are 4 <a href="http://www.towlr.com/">towlr</a> games created by different Ludum Dare regulars featured on the <em>official site</em>. More are in development and/or require some py2exe love. If there ever was a Ludum Dare inside joke/critique on game design, it&#8217;s this. Towlr is watching. Towlr waits. May you discover the cake in each.

    The <a href="http://www.igfmobile.com/php-bin/entries2009_mobile.php">IGF Mobile entries list</a> went live the other day. A <em>relieved</em> mere 104 entries. Hehe, with my entry number of 754, I was a little worried. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.galcon.com">Phil</a> and I are both there, as well as several people I&#8217;ve been chatting with via e-mail, forums, IRC and <a href="http://twitter.com/mikekasprzak">Twitter</a>. Plus, as far as I can tell, each category of a classic IGF is available too so&#8230; dare I say&#8230; there&#8217;s actually a chance of being a finalist for something. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />

    I&#8217;ve been marketing like a <em>machine</em>. Tuesday night, Apple went live with a feature that lets you send promotional codes good for a free copy of games. They limit you to 50 codes per game, and with 3 games worth of codes at my disposal I&#8217;ve been <em>getting creative</em>. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

    This image I lifted from <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/apple-begins-promo-code-program-for-iphone-apps/">an article on iLounge</a>. It seems I was aggressive enough to get a mention. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />

    I&#8217;ve nearly used up all my <strong>Smiles</strong> freebies. I&#8217;m saving a few for emergencies, but <strong>Smiles Zen</strong> and <strong>Smiles Drop</strong> codes have proved to be good giveaways for <a href="http://www.148apps.com">iPhone game sites</a>. A <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=1795">little</a> <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=1798">promotion</a> I did today was met with some pretty good response. One and two minutes later, and the codes were all gone.

    Googling for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=smiles+game">Smiles Game</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=smiles+iphone">Smile iPhone</a>&#8221; now finally yields some results related to the game. Excellent. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> . Cracking the &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=smiles">Smiles</a>&#8221; search term is going to be a <em>real</em> battle. Bottom of page 9 last I checked. I just have to keep people talking. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

  <p>
    First off, <strong>Smiles</strong> is currently averaging a <strong>4.8 Star</strong> user rating worldwide. That&#8217;s pretty great. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

    <a href="http://osxreality.com/2008/11/17/smiles-review-a-relaxing-matching-game-with-fun-graphics/">OSX Reality</a> gave Smiles a nice <strong>4 Star</strong> review. The only beef was likely solved with the recent release of <em>the split</em>.

    <a href="http://www.bwana.tv/2008/12/05/smiles-for-iphone-offers-hours-of-fun/">Bwana.tv</a> approves of Smiles in a <strong>Video Review</strong>. A shame he didn&#8217;t find the multiple touches feature in Drop yet. I need to make this more obvious in v1.1.

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.hiwiller.com/2008/11/26/iphone-game-reviews-part-1-of-3/">A blogger</a> discovered Smiles, and seems to think it&#8217;s worth the money. That&#8217;s good. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.theiphoneblog.com/2008/12/03/quick-app-smiles-iphone/">The iPhone Blog</a> liked my alternative to the usual price drop madness plaguing the iPhone.
  </p>

    I&#8217;m going to skip syndication this time, since there&#8217;s so much of it. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

    So wow, lots going on. I know I&#8217;ve missed something, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got for now.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the mean time, <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare 13</a> is tomorrow. I&#8217;ll be all over that and then some. Then to finish (start) this workstation format, and get back to the fun.

  <p>
    Until next time.
