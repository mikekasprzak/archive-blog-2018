Well alright. I agreed to do a little contract gig back during the summer that finally caught up with me, so the past couple weeks were spent on that. Yesterday we finally finished and submitted that, so I&#8217;m free to work on what&#8217;s _really_ important: Smiles HD for computers!

Wait&#8230; what!?

Okay, well I still do have my new-game scheduling plans detailed in the last post, but I&#8217;ll be slightly delaying that start time yet again, but not by much. After a general assessment of all the code and stuff I have, I think Smiles HD needs another serious week of work before it&#8217;s ready to be packaged and uploaded to every digital distribution store known to man. On my whiteboard for the past several months was a short 4 item TODO list; The 4 things necessary to finally finish (in my mind) the PC version 1.0&#8217;s. In all seriousness though, there are more than 4 things that should be done, but I wont know them all until I seriously dive in to it.

Still, that is my agenda. This month, I want to be &#8220;finished&#8221; and finally getting the game in to digital distribution. I plan to be more vocal and open about the development of my newer projects, and I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of pre-order and donate boxes, so I&#8217;d rather have a tangible product you could easily buy to support me and my new games. &#8220;Here&#8217;s me talking, buy this game to keep me talking&#8221;. That&#8217;s not to say it wont happen (watching how indie games have evolved over the years), but that&#8217;s not Plan A.

**Q: Will there be public beta testing?**

Maybe! I want to say yes, but until it happens my answer is a head-nod and silly grin while my eyes wander the room.

**Q: What will be available first?**

The first release (either beta or final) will be the Windows version. I think I&#8217;ve previously mentioned, though I&#8217;m a heavy Linux/Unix tools user, I do the bulk of my work on Windows.

Over the past couple weeks I&#8217;ve been contacting and chatting with a hand full of digital distributors. Apple&#8217;s Mac App Store is an obvious choice (I bought a Magic Trackpad specifically for testing), but that doesn&#8217;t launch for a couple months. So after the Windows version I&#8217;ll be playing it by ear, but have a suspicion Linux will be next, followed by Mac or maybe Android.

The goal is to be selling all 3 (in one way or another) by the end of the month.

**Q: Wait, Android? What happened to that &#8220;Canadian&#8217;s can&#8217;t sell&#8221; problem?**

Fortunately that era has finally ended, and not a moment too soon either. I&#8217;ve been promising a faithful Palm Pre->HTC Evo Smiles player that I&#8217;d do an Android port as soon as I was able, so I need to make good on that promise. ðŸ™‚

**Q: Android Public Beta?**

Because Android devices are so vast and plentiful, I think I **need** to public beta this. I myself have a Google G1, Nexus One, and a Tegra 2 Dev Board, but as I&#8217;ve seen that&#8217;s hardly enough.

That&#8217;s all for now. I have a little writeup to do for Ludum Dare now (That October Challenge thing? Yeah, I started it, but couldn&#8217;t even finish myself! How shameful!), and then it&#8217;s time to do that stuff above.
