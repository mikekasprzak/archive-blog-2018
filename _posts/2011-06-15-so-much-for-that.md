Hey, well that didn&#8217;t work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.

<div id="attachment_4315" style="max-width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Win7.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Win7-640x460.png" alt="" title="Win7" width="640" height="460" class="size-large wp-image-4315" srcset="http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Win7-640x460.png 640w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Win7-450x324.png 450w, http://blog.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Win7.png 725w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there&#8217;s practically no noticeable spike.

Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things.
