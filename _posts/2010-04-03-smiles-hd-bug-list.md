Wow! So _that_ was iPad launch day.

I&#8217;ll talk a little more about the &#8220;day 1 FREE&#8221; experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn&#8217;t going to talk about this!

Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day **without** actually testing it on a real device. There were rumors that some developers had devices, but that wasn&#8217;t me. I plan to talk more about my &#8220;no actual hardware&#8221; process, but it is getting late, and today was rather exhausting.

Anyways, now that I have an actual iPad (see above), it&#8217;s bug hunting time.

**Smiles HD** actually did extremely well. No showstopper bugs, the game is fully playable top to bottom, just a small handful of oddities. Those include:

**1. Music is sometimes jumpy when a game/the menus start.**
  
This one was unexpected, and unfortunate. At the moment I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s causing it, since music plays just fine in the simulator. But admittedly, music was added last minute, so it could be something I messed up. \*shrug\*. To be investigated.

**2. Clipping bug on Achievements Screen when wide.**
  
Awww! I was pretty sure I caught all the clipping bugs, but the clipping on the Achievement screen I am doing something stupid, so I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised. Ah well, easy fix.

**3. Skip-track then mute causes game to crash!** (submitted by Angelo)
  
Yikes, I totally missed this one! It actually crashes the PC version too! Should be an easy fix. Nice find Angelo! ðŸ™‚

And&#8230; that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got. If you find any more, leave me a comment or send me an e-mail.

There are some frame-rate issues that pop up at times, but none of them hinder the game at all.

I will be getting on those soon. I also have a list of things I&#8217;d like to sneak in that didn&#8217;t make the March 27th and 31st deadline. I&#8217;ll detail those when I get a chance. The above plus that should make **Smiles HD** 1.1 a good incremental update.

I&#8217;ll be playing the game lots on a real deal device in the coming days. If you have any thoughts on play, responsiveness, stumbling, etc, feel free to leave me a comment.

Online scoring, I want it just as much as you! ðŸ˜€

If I can make a healthy dent in the Top 100 paid charts, it will be sooner than later. Giving the game away for FREE was definitely a risky move, but I know the game is good; I just needed _some way_ of standing out in the launch day crowd. So hey, if the crazy scheme works and everyone plays it, loves it, and tells their friends, then you will _definitely_ be seeing online high scores soon.

Unfortunately, that appears to be all the rational thought my brain has left in it for tonight.

Until tomorrow.
