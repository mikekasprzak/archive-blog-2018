I&#8217;ve been busy pulling a prototype together. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have much to say just yet. I have a pretty ambitious goal to meet by the end of this month, and I&#8217;ll gladly talk about it then. I even brought on some help, as I think timing is crucial.

If this works out, we should see some PuffBOMB action in about a year.

I like consoles.
