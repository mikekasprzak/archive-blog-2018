Ranting&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

I suppose I&#8217;ve been &#8220;writing&#8221; music with trackers for about 13 years (Scream, Impulse, Modplug, Buzz, Renoise). Alas, my results have been less than satisfactory. I want to take this moment to apologize to everyone I ever recommended trackers to.

Sorry.

Sometime last month I set out to find a better music app. I&#8217;d already entered the world of VST&#8217;s thanks to Renoise, having put down a big $600 for [Colossus](http://www.soundsonline.com/Quantum-Leap-Colossus-pr-EW-164.html). I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time in Adobe Audition (Cool Edit) over the years too, so that&#8217;s where I started. I wanted something akin to it&#8217;s multi-track view, that I could sequence midi in. I decided to give all the big name non proprietary apps a go (i.e. Pro Tools). FL Studio, Acid Pro, Sonar, and Live.

[FL Studio](http://www.fruityloops.com/), I love the synth VST&#8217;s it comes with. But I honestly got lost in the interface, trying to figure out how I was supposed to track stuff.

[Sony&#8217;s Acid Pro](http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/showproduct.asp?pid=1005) was the easiest to get up to speed in. A good app. It generally did everything I was looking for exactly how I wanted it, scroll wheel and all. It can create &#8220;ghost clips&#8221; too (i.e. update the original, and all clones get the changes). However, I was having troubles using multiple Colossus instances.

For one reason or another, I glazed over and generally ignored [Sonar](http://www.cakewalk.com/sonar/). It reminded me too much of [Cubase](http://www.steinberg.net/33+M52087573ab0.html). Nice job with an impartial assessment there Mike.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' />

I ended up going with [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com/). It&#8217;s certainly a qwirky program, doing just about everything in it&#8217;s own way (click+up/down to zoom, click+left/right to pan). It actually took a lot of effort to really understand how to work in the app. But it does so many things right for how I want to work. Cross platform, since I have this mindset that I want the option to go Mac one day. And the key point as I saw it. You can bake tracks! OMG! If you&#8217;ve used a heavy hard drive streaming sound sample library like Colossus (Kompakt) or Giga Studio, you&#8217;ll note that one of your bottlenecks is the number of instruments you can play at one time, before your playback begins to stutter. I hit that at about 3 separate instruments (with numerous layers each). Not a problem with Live. Right click on a track you&#8217;re not working on this moment, hit &#8220;freeze track&#8221;, and within several seconds it&#8217;s rendered that track to disk. Then when you want to edit it again, right click and unfreeze it. Mmmmm.

That feature alone sold me.

But as I started digging through the interface and tutorials more, I really think I made the right decision. The interface has 2 views. A clip editing/mixer view, and a master song arrangement view. I wont delve in to all the details, but you can actually edit clips in both views. The clip/mixer view is actually designed for more of a &#8220;program the song and perform it live by queuing rows&#8221; type interface monster, but I found another use for it. Doodles. I don&#8217;t know how everybody else works, but sometimes as I&#8217;m toying on my midi keyboard to come up with a part or layer, I come up with something interesting, but it doesn&#8217;t work for this song. In the past, I had no way to record these random brainstorms. With Live, I solo the track, pound an empty clip&#8217;s record button, and record my music doodle. Then I can easily tweak my notes, if I hit something too early or too soft, and it doesn&#8217;t hurt my song at all. I can then export the mini composition to a .mid file, to use elsewhere.

So in conclusion, I&#8217;d like again apologize to anyone I ever recommended trackers to.
