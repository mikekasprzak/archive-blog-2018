One of **two** promotional videos I&#8217;m making. This one is the &#8220;hands on&#8221; one, requiring a silly looking &#8220;camera on tripod hugging thing&#8221; to collect all the footage.

In this video, I&#8217;m unfortunately assuming the player will pick up on all the nice things why this isn&#8217;t a Bejeweled clone. But to be sure, I&#8217;m going to spell it out next video, and briefly mention some of things not covered here.

EDIT: Updated the linked video here to point to the edited version. Still likely I&#8217;ll add some commentary.
