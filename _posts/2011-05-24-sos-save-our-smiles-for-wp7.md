Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my &#8220;Microsoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account&#8221; yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.

I made this game (**Smiles**), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:



It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?

Prior to launch, I participated in a Windows Phone 7 press event in Toronto, amongst other things.

The WP7 version hasn&#8217;t done very well.

    Well, at least the graph looks cool... I guess

I don&#8217;t want much:

All I want is to cover the annual platform cost ($99).

At **$2.99** (70% of is $2.09), that&#8217;s about 50 sales total&#8230; but to make matters worse, I think I have to earn $250 before I will get a single payout (feel free to correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). That and my bank charges something stupid like $40 to receive a payment these days (gee thanks CIBC), but $250 should cover all that.

A few months back, I thought I&#8217;d try something. Inside the control panel, there&#8217;s a checkbox that says whether a game has a trial version or not. We never added code to handle the trial, but I decided to click that checkbox anyways. Ahem, let me rephrase this&#8230;

So great! Visit the Zune store right now, and go get yourself a **free full game**. And if you like it, please buy it. If I can&#8217;t earn enough for a payout, **I wont be renewing and it will automatically remove the game from the Zune store**.

If your PC is set up correctly, you can click here:

</center>

Otherwise, search for **Smiles**.

My total investment in the WP7 version of the game was about $3000. Being realistic, I don&#8217;t expect to recoup those costs. Still, if can at least earn the $250 necessary for a payout, then I wont have to remove it. I think it&#8217;s fair to expect a platform to be capable of covering its own annual costs, don&#8217;t you? 

So tell your friends, everyone with a WP7 phone! Come get a free game, and if you like it, buy it and support me for just a few bucks. Thanks! 

PS: The game is also available for several other phones and devices:
