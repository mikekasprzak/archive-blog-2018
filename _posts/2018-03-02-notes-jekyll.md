[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a tool static website generation, similar to a blog or CMS. It's notable because it's **built in to GitHub**.

## Setup
To run a local instance, do the following setup:

```bash
# Install Ruby
sudo apt install ruby gem ruby-dev

# Install Jekyll
sudo gem install jekyll
```

You're also going to want to install your theme and any plugins.

```bash
sudo gem install minima
sudo gem install jekyll-admin
```

To view the website locally, run the Jekyll server:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

You can then visit it at the following URL:

[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

## Creating a blog
Do the following:

```bash
jekyll new myblog
```

This creates a folder `myblog/` containing all the essential files to get you started.

## Structure of a Jekyll website
The core files are as follows:

```bash
_config.yml    # Jekyll configuration file
Gemfile        # Ruby and Jekyll Plugin configuration file
Gemfile.lock   # DO NOT EDIT: the processed Gemfile
index.md       # like an `index.html`. typically used to trigger a layout

_posts/        # where posts go
_layouts/      # (implicit) Layouts of the theme
_includes/     # (implicit) Files included by layouts
_sass/         # (implicit) SASS style sheets for the theme

# optional files 
about.md       # a pretty-common page (i.e. `/about`/)
404.html       # what to display when the page isn't found
CNAME          # a GitHub CNAME record configuration file
_data/         # where data files (i.e. JSON, other data) can go. Jekyll Admin has a built in editor

# generated files
_site/         # where generated files go
```

Though implicit files are optional, they exist inside the current **theme** you are using. When you want to override the defaults of a theme, be sure the file exists. Otherwise the installed gem version is used.

## Structure of a Jekyll file (Front Matter)
_Front Matter_ is a special YAML formatted header found in various Jekyll files used to describe metadata. The data is contained between a set of triple dashes (i.e. `---`). Front Matter can be applied to other files (such as images) implicitly through the configuration.

A markown file might look like this:

```ruby
---
layout: post
title: A Blog Post
---
This is my blog post.

# Headline
Some text below a headline

* Item 1
* Item 2

{% if something %}
This will be omitted
{% endif %}
```

An HTML file might look like this:

```ruby
---
layout: default
---

<div class="container">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

## Jekyll-Admin UI
If you install the **Jekyll-Admin** plug, you get access to a powerful UI for editing pages.

[http://localhost:4000/admin/](http://localhost:4000/admin/)

## Important: Metadata and Jekyll Admin
At the time of this writing, it is necessary to manually include metedata in the metadata section below your posts. Otherwise, posts generated by **Jekyll Admin** will not display correctly.

You should add:

* **date** - will give you a calender icon that you can click to pick. defaults to now.
* **layout** - set this to `post`, otherwise you get no style.

## GitHub Setup
Create a repo, and go in to the settings. From there, make sure the **source** is set to the **master** branch.

## Wrapup
Push your changes to your GitHub repo, and they should become live in a minute. If there's an error building your page, you will get an error via e-mail.
