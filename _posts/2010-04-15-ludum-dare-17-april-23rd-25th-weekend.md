[Ludum Dare #17](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) is coming up next weekend. If the idea of crunching together a game from scratch in 48 hours interests you, check us out.

Now, this compo has been a little different. We announced our date nice and early, so the people at GDC would know about it, and to save us from silly &#8220;when will the compo be?&#8221; questions. So really, it was probably our best pre-announcement for a compo date to date.

Then something happened.

Watching Twitter as I often do, I catch an offhand remark from [Nelson](http://www.casuallyhardcore.com/), a friend and former coworker of mine.

> TOJam #5 (<http://www.tojam.ca>) happening April 23 to 25th at George Brown College &#8211; not officially, but I have an inside source.

Now that&#8217;s a familiar date.

At GDC 2009 I had the chance to hang out and get to know some of the ToJam guys. [Jim](http://www.bigpants.ca), [Mike](http://www.spyeart.com), etc. So GDC 2010 was rather funny to meet up with these guys again, like &#8220;Hey, I like 2 hours away, but I only ever see you in San Fransisco&#8221;. Jim and I regular some of the same forums and sites, so we do hear from each-other in passing throughout the year.

And then, there was the date conflict.

When I first learned about, I was totally thinking to myself &#8220;Dude! We totally have to play this up!&#8221;. Fortunately, Jim did not disappoint, and began this e-mail exchange.

You can [read the rest here](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/04/09/tojam-vs-ludum-dare/).

One of the many silly things we do on the Ludum Dare site prior to the compo is motivational posters. So I&#8217;ve kicked off our motivational poster game with some ToJam bashing.

Also we had a [brief back-and-forth on TIGForums](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=12058.0).

So yes, we are being quite childish, but it&#8217;s all in good fun. Two notable game making events running on the same weekend, it&#8217;d be a waste NOT to do something silly with that. ðŸ™‚
