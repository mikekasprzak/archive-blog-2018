GameTunnel&#8217;s [Monthly Roundup for April](http://www.gametunnel.com/html/section-viewarticle-112.html) is up. Twas a good month, many cool games, and I didn&#8217;t make much of an ass of myself either. Bonus  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />. The roundup&#8217;s have been a fun little research project of mine, gathering tactical and other information about what&#8217;s going on in the world of indie gaming. Impressive enough, I just broke the 100 review barrier. I&#8217;m now sitting at 101 reviews. Wow. That&#8217;s &#8230; many!

My break from the commercial world of game development draws closer and closer. I&#8217;m up late now after fixing a pair of nasty bugs in a game for work that have been haunting me for a while. It&#8217;ll be nice one day to be doing this for my own game.

The plan for Too Normal is sketches and game related stuffs, and some analysis of what I do. Art from the perspective of a programmer. What I am thinking as I draw a picture or making production art. I&#8217;d imagine there might be some interest in that. Heck, that&#8217;s what I want to read.
