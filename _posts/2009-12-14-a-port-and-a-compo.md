Wow. To say the last 3 weeks have been busy would be an understatement.

First of all, I ported **Smiles** to a new phone. The **Samsung Omnia II**, a Windows Mobile phone with a beautiful amoled screen and a custom GPU. Some photos.

For those keeping score, the game unfortunately runs a little slow on the Omnia II. It&#8217;s definitely playable, but the GPU is no PowerVR SGX. I did what I could in the time I had, optimized my shaders and all that, but it&#8217;s what it is. I&#8217;ll post some videos later once I have more platforms to compare. 

I&#8217;ll come back to this.

Next is Ludum Dare 16, which was this past weekend. Amazingly, we got **[121 entries](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview)** this time, and it&#8217;s December!? Historically, December is always our slowest compo, but 121 is just 2 less than April.

Now, I don&#8217;t really know what happened, but 2009 has been an _incredible_ year for Ludum Dare. In August of 2008 we ended the silly &#8220;constantly moving&#8221; game we&#8217;ve played over the years, and returned to LudumDare.com. Our entries for that and the next were average (I think 60-70 each, I&#8217;ll have to do some digging to get all the numbers). But 2009 hit and we&#8217;ve been setting records ever since.

I&#8217;d like to find some time before the new year to write up a proper retrospective of 2009. Voting ends January 3rd, so it&#8217;d be a fitting thing to have for then. We&#8217;ll see.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

But the crunch has only just begun.

Next on my agenda is to finish-up the Italian build of Smiles Drop. Yes, in case you didn&#8217;t notice, the Zen shot above is in Italian (but please ignore the word UNDO, k-thx-bye!). The Samsung ports I did for a contest held by Samsung. They wanted builds in both English and Italian, and I was able to deliver 3 of 4 (Zen and Drop standalone, no bundle). The Zen Italian build I finished and submitted 10 minutes before the deadline. If I had 2 more hours, I could have finished Drop too. Ah well. All that&#8217;s left is to fix is a couple lines of text that are too long, and to package it up.

After that, the crunch continues. I&#8217;d like to finish a Netbook version of Smiles by the 20th, or at least power through this features todo list I have in front of me. That&#8217;s the plan anyways.

After that, I guess I can take a few days off. ðŸ˜‰

So fun fun. Back to the grind.
