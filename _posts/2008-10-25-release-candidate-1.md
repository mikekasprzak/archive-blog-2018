It&#8217;s late, now 5 AM Saturday morning. Release Candidate 1 is just a few hours away. Some achievement tweaks, and minor bugs and we&#8217;re good.

Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it&#8217;ll be live in the App Store.

I&#8217;d have taken a photo, but I&#8217;m currently cameraless.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

The dummy website for the game:

<http://www.smiles-game.com>

Some time after it goes out, I&#8217;ll make a proper site.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

A couple weeks back I also updated the PuffBOMB website:

<http://www.puffbomb.com>
  
(there are secrets in his eyes!)

Nothing new per se, but a teaser image from the console remake that&#8230; well&#8230; I&#8217;ll now be porting to the iPhone.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

EDIT: Finished RC1 around 8:00 PM today (Saturday). As mentioned, I&#8217;m going to take the rest of the weekend to run through the game a few more times, and if everything checks out, send it off Monday Afternoon.
