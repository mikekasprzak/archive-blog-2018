I like books. I own many books. These are books that I like.

## Programming and Math

**3d Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development**, by Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parberry &#8211; The **BEST** and easiest to understand book on the fundamental mathematics of 3D games: Vectors and Matrices. You might say &#8220;oh but this other book covers more&#8221;, but don&#8217;t be fooled! The quality of how everything is taught in books is DRAMATICALLY different. I did a [very scientific study](http://junk.mikekasprzak.com/Research/Math%20Books/). I compared how each book describes what a vector is. You&#8217;re welcome to come to your own conclusions, but in my opinion this book is by far the best.

**Real Time Rendering** &#8211; A solid &#8220;introduction to everything&#8221; graphics book. There are several books on modern realtime graphics, but RTR is one of the most comprehensive available, and doesn&#8217;t require a math degree to read. It&#8217;s heavy in its theory and scope (and actual weight), but easily the best single resource.

**[Advanced Character Physics](http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030121/jacobson_pfv.htm)**, by Thomas Jacobsen &#8211; Not a book, but a truly fantastic physics article. This little article made me a competent physics programmer, before we had an abundance of usable middleware. I highly recommend it. 

**Real Time Collision Detection**, by Christer Ericson &#8211; For the hardcore, there is no better book on the topic of collision detection than this. If you&#8217;re planning to use middleware, you can probably skip this and rely on the collision sections of 3D Math Primer or RTR. But if you&#8217;ve ever wanted to live and breath CD, it&#8217;s a must have.

**Game Programming Gems (series)** &#8211; Gems books are big, huge, collections of articles. As of writing, GPG is up to its 8th volume. These books are without a doubt, the most densely packed tomes of game programming knowledge available. New volumes are released every 1-2 years, and if you&#8217;re keeping up, contain cutting edge information from highly anticipated games months (sometimes years) before their release. These are not guides how to make games, but how to make better games. These are books that you can refer to constantly throughout your career in games

**Game Engine Gems (series)** &#8211; A new series in the tradition of the gems books, this time on the architecting of game engines. Other series do a great job keeping you up to date on the latest rendering techniques. GEG is about tying it all together. It&#8217;s thinner than some of the gems books, but the content is fantastic. In my latest round of engine preproduction research, I think I pulled more design ideas out of this one book than any other. Great!

**OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide** &#8211; This purple book (oddly referred to as the Gold book in the preface) is one of the most important books you can own as a 3D programmer. OpenGL is a relatively old standard, a good one, but it&#8217;s picked up some fat over the years. That&#8217;s what makes the ES guide especially great, since OpenGL ES as a standard literally a &#8220;best of&#8221; OpenGL. Almost everything you write OpenGL ES style will work as-in in OpenGL. There are a few minor differences (glSomeFunctionf vs. glSomeFunction, glSomeExtensionEXT vs. glSomeExtensionOGL vs glSomeExtension (when it becomes standard)), but adhering to the GL ES spec will help you write better OpenGL code.

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d recommend this to a beginner (pick either the OpenGL Red Book or the OpenGL Super Bible when starting), but I&#8217;d say this is far more useful than the Orange book (Shading guide).

**AI Game Programming Wisdom (series)** &#8211; AI Wisdom is a spin off series from GPG. The focus here is on artificial intelligence, both the simulation of (classic AI, strategy, etc), and the perception of (scripting, dialog trees, etc).

**Shader X (series)** &#8211; Yet another Gems like series, this time on shader programming (effects and everything). This series is complete now with a total of 8 books (two different volume 2&#8217;s).

**GPU Pro (series)** &#8211; A new series from the editor Shader X, GPU Pro continues where it left off. Now in **full color**, as any book on graphics effects should be. ðŸ˜‰

**GPU Gems (series)** &#8211; Sponsored by NVidia, these are _even more_ rendering and shader related articles. These books can be read online on NVidia&#8217;s developer page, and contain mostly research conducted by NVidia and their partners. This series followed a similar timeline as the Shader X books, and makes a great compliment to that series. The printed versions are in **full color**, and make good use of it too.

Alternatively, NVidia has made all 3 books in the series available online for free. [One](http://developer.nvidia.com/content/gpu-gems-part-i-natural-effects) [Two](http://developer.nvidia.com/node/17) [Three](http://developer.nvidia.com/content/gpu-gems-3).

**More &#8220;Gems Like&#8221; Series**: Massively Multiplayer Game Development 1-2, Infinite Game Universe (two books on procedural generation), Graphics Programming Methods, Graphics Gems 1-5 (the original gems series)

I&#8217;ll be honest, you don&#8217;t need the Graphics Gems books. They&#8217;re very dated by today&#8217;s standards (software rendering), and only of historic interest. Maybe that interests you, but in practice, you don&#8217;t need it.

As for the rest of these, your mileage may vary. They&#8217;re good books to complete your collection, but I&#8217;ll be honest, I refer to them very rarely (almost never).

## Writing

One of my more recent avenues of research is on writing. It&#8217;s weird when I think about it, but I am actually a published technical writer. The idea that I&#8217;m considered _an expert_ on some subjects still surprises me, even though it probably shouldn&#8217;t (I&#8217;ve been making games &#8220;professionally&#8221; for over 10 years now). Maybe it&#8217;s the insight or the irony of _the professional_ to think he doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing. I may already be a writer, but in my mind I&#8217;m still working to earn that title.

**How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy**, by Orson Scott Card &#8211; The first book I sat down to read after getting a list from a writer friend. Also the first place I saw the term &#8220;Speculative Fiction&#8221;, which I find to be an excellent generalization of both genres.

**How to Write Killer Fiction**, by Wheat &#8211; Like Orson Scott Card&#8217;s book is to Sci Fi and Fantasy, Wheat&#8217;s book is to Mystery and Suspense. Walks through the cliches and structure common to both genres, and how they support each-other. 

**Fire in Fiction** (good look at style, opening)

**How to Write for Animation**, by Jeffry Scott &#8211; Some years back, I was on a kick buying film and comic writing reference. This book impressed me with its clear writing style, its understanding of writing for serialized television (cartoons), and a bit of nostalgia (written by one of the writers of the classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, and even includes a script).

## Business and Lifestyle

I am an independent game developer that did several years in the games industry before returning to &#8220;indie games&#8221;. From that view, it should be a clear I don&#8217;t follow the same _logic_ as regular business folk. The subject of business for me is a combination of technical, lifestyle and inspiration, so expect some off-beat titles here.

**Business and Legal forms for Graphics Designers** &#8211; It seems unlikely we&#8217;ll ever get an equivalent book for small game development studios, but this book is practically all you need anyways. The book comes with a CD containing all the forms found inside the book. Use them as a template for all your crazy business dealings, and search+replace the word &#8220;Designer&#8221; with &#8220;Developer&#8221; and you&#8217;re set.

**Bakuman** &#8211; Okay, this is actually a Japanese comic book series (manga) by the creators of Death Note. Its an exaggerated look at the life of a comic book creating duo (writer and artist). It&#8217;s a surprisingly topical series for us super small game developers, where our teams are just a few guys, creating and publishing work through some of the biggest distribution channels out there. In their case Shueisha (publisher of Jump, the #1 weekly serial mag in Japan), and our case it&#8217;s Apple, Steam, Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, etc. Creating, charting, sales, merchandising, cancellation, motivation, friendship, rivalry, and life are major points of the series. The comic itself is published by Shueisha in their #1 mag (Jump), so it doubles as this weird meta exaggerated inside look at how their industry works. I find the series incredibly entertaining, and can&#8217;t recommend it enough to fellow developers. It wont make you a better game developer, but it might inspire you to be one.

&#8211; pick something good on comic/writing life

blah blah about indie and game business, since it&#8217;s weird. We&#8217;re all children and like booze.

## Art and Audio

I own a lot of books on art/drawing and sound/music. And honestly, I wish I could point to something and say &#8220;this will make you a better artist or musician&#8221;. Both disciplines for me though were very much a matter sitting down and doing it to get anywhere; That&#8217;s probably true of all disciplines. Learn the tools, and practice+study until you start getting compliments; Then practice and study harder.

&#8211; ???

## Reference

Finally, a list of topical books that wont teach you much, but are great resources to have on hand. Ideas, mythology, biology and habitat, fact checking, or general reference.

**Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition (series)** &#8211; The recent Dungeons and Dragons books are a series of gorgeous hardcover books, available individually for about $20 each, or in a box set. Even if you don&#8217;t have a group handy for a regular campaign, if you&#8217;re a role playing or fantasy game developer, you can&#8217;t help but be inspired by these. The artwork, the stats, everything. And for further entertainment value, take a listen to the [D&D gaming podcasts](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/podcasts.aspx) with the Penny Arcade crew.

## TODO

I have lots of books, but I haven&#8217;t read or seriously looked at them all yet. Some I may have glanced at, but I haven&#8217;t yet formed a serious opinion of their significance yet. Here&#8217;s a list of books that seem useful (or are often recommended), but I haven&#8217;t absorbed enough of them to agree or disagree yet.
